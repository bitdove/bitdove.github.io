M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to another podcast here atEnglishPod! My name 
is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we have a fun dialogue. 
E: That’s right, well, maybe the language in this lesson you won’t use everyday, but, um, 
it’s… it’s fun, it’s interesting and it’s a little bit on the lighter side. 
M: That’s right, today we’re gonna be looking at baby talk. So, we’re gonna see some of 
these words that aren’t really words. They’re not real words that you can find in the 
dictionary, but, uh, native English speakers use them when they’re taking to little babies. 
E: Yeah, in many languages there’s… there’s a rule for how you make baby talk words, 
right? 
M: Right. 
E: But in English we don’t have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word. 
So, we’re gonna teach you a few of these baby words. 
M: Exactly, so, uh, before we listen to the dialogue, why don’t we take a look at 
“vocabulary preview”? 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: Okay, we have two words here we’re going to hear in the dialogue, um, and the first one 
is diaper. 
M: Diaper. 
E: Diaper. 
M: Okay, so, a diaper. A baby uses a diaper. 
E: That’s right, it’s a… it’s a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby, so that 
it can go to the bathroom and not make a mess. 
M: Okay, a diaper. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, we also have another word that we commonly use in English language, it’s nana. 
E: Nana. 
M: Nana. 
E: So, nana is the name we call a grandmother. 
M: Right, so, an informal name just like in Spanish we would say something 
like abue or abuelita. 
E: Or in Italian you might say oma. This is another way that we can call a grandma or 
granny - nana. 
M: Okay, so, nana. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Why don’t we listen to the dialogue for the first time? Let’s see how these new parents 
are talking to their little baby using baby talk. 
A: Honey, the baby is up again.
B: It’s your turn! I went last night.
A: Fine! Hello widdle baby! Why are you crying wid-
dle baby? Oh, I see, you made a doo-doo!
B: What’s going on hun? Why is the baby crying?
A: The widdle baby made a doo -doo!
B: What a good boy! Lets get this icky diaper off you.
A: Looky what I have here! Mickey Mouse jammies!
oopsie-daisy! Did the widdle baby just tinkle all
over daddy?
B: Yes he did! Yes he did! You just made a wee wee
all over daddy!
A: Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.
C: What going on in here?
A: Oh look it’s nana! Say hi to nana!
C: He’s so adorable! I could just eat him up!
A: Ok, say bye to nana! Time to go beddy - bye!
E: Okay, well, that was pretty cute, wasn’t it? 
M: A cute dialogue and the baby seemed to be cute and, well, everyone’s excited about the 
new baby. 
E: Uhu, but they used some really interesting little words that are pretty unfamiliar, so, let’s 
look at them now in “language takeaway”. 
[Voice: Language takeaway.] 
M: Alright, so, as we mentioned before, these words aren’t actually words. They… you won’t 
find them in the dictionary. 
E: Right, but you’ll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might 
see them in a movie or something like that. So, why don’t we get started with the first one? 
M: Alright, the first word that may seem a little bit strange, uh, the father said 
“Hello widdle baby”. 
E: Widdle baby. 
M: Okay, widdle. 
E: So, widdle is just, um, a baby talk way of saying “little”. 
M: Little, that’s right. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, the father saw that the baby was crying, because he made adoo-doo. 
E: The baby made the doo-doo, not the father. 
M: Right, the baby made a doo-doo. 
E: Uhu, a doo-doo. 
M: Okay, so, basically, a doo-doo is, ah, when the baby poos orpoops in the diaper. 
E: Okay, so, you know, sometimes you go to the bathroom and it might take a little bit 
longer. 
M: Exactly. 
E: That’s cause of the doo-doo. 
M: The doo-doo. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Right, the actual technical or maybe the proper English word for this would be defecate. 
E: Okay, so, make a doo-doo. 
M: Alright, now, our third words are interesting because he said “Ickydiaper”. 
E: That’s right, an icky diaper. 
M: And then he also said yucky. 
E: So, we’ve got two words here that mean the same thing – icky andyucky. 
M: Uhu, and basically means disgusting. 
E: Right, something that’s really, really not nice. 
M: Aha, so you would say icky or yucky. 
E: Now, these words have other similar words. We might recognize ickor yuck. 
M: Right, so, you would use ick or yuck if something is disgusting, but when you’re kind of 
talking to a baby, you would say icky, yucky. 
E: Uhu, yeah… 
M: Smelly. 
E: It’s the adjective. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Now, our next word, um, the… the father said he has some Mickey Mouse jammies. 
M: Jammies. 
E: Jammies. 
M: Okay, so, what are jammies? 
E: Well. The words jammies is short for pajamas. 
M: Okay, pajamas, so, the clothes that you put on when you go to sleep. 
E: Uhu, jammies. 
M: Jammies, alright, and now for our last two words, they mean the same thing as well. The 
little baby tinkled all over daddy. 
E: So, to tinkle. 
M: And then his mom said “A wee-wee all over daddy”. 
E: You made a wee-wee. 
M: Okay, so, tinkle and wee-wee. 
E: Basically, also going to the bathroom, but this time to pee. 
M: To pee, exactly. 
E: Yeah. 
M: To urinate. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Wee-wee. 
E: So, the verb - to tinkle and the noun - a wee-wee. 
M: Uhu, very good. So, these are the words that we have for you today in language 
takeaway. As you can see they’re kind of cute and very common when you’re talking to 
babies and, you know, you have to be a little bit nicer. 
E: Uhu, alright, so, why don’t we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit slower and 
you’ll catch these words a little bit easier. 
A: Honey, the baby is up again.
B: It’s your turn! I went last night.
A: Fine! Hello widdle baby! Why are you crying wid-
dle baby? Oh, I see, you made a doo-doo!
B: What’s going on hun? Why is the baby crying?
A: The widdle baby made a doo -doo!
B: What a good boy! Lets get this icky diaper off you.
A: Looky what I have here! Mickey Mouse jammies!
oopsie-daisy! Did the widdle baby just tinkle all
over daddy?
B: Yes he did! Yes he did! You just made a wee wee
all over daddy!
A: Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.
C: What going on in here?
A: Oh look it’s nana! Say hi to nana!
C: He’s so adorable! I could just eat him up!
A: Ok, say bye to nana! Time to go beddy - bye!
M: Alright, so, now that we’ve seen those great words, let’s take a look at two phrases that 
we’re gonna look at now in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: So, the mother didn’t really wanna get up and… and, um, look afterthe baby, she 
said it’s your turn. 
M: It’s your turn. 
E: It’s your turn. 
M: So, when she says “It’s your turn”… 
E: That means “You should do it now”. 
M: Right, so, she’s basically saying “Now you have to do it”; I did it last time, so now you 
have to do it. 
E: Uhu. 
M: It’s your turn. 
E: That’s right, it’s your turn. And, well, the nana, the grandmother, she was really… of 
course, she really loves this little baby and she saidI could just eat him up. 
M: I could just eat him up. 
E: I could just eat him up. 
M: Now, does she wanna really eat him? Cause… 
E: No, of course. 
M: So… 
E: Of course, not. 
M: Uh, wha… so, what’s, uh… what does she mean by this? 
E: This is a phrase we often use with very cute things. It just means “Oh, my God, he’s so 
cute!” 
M: Okay, he’s so cute that I wish I could just hug him and kiss him a lot. 
E: Yes! We might use this with babies or maybe with puppies. I could just eat them up. 
M: Alright, so, great two phrases that we’ve just taken a look at. Let’s go back to our 
dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back and talk a little bit more about these 
babies. 
A: Honey, the baby is up again.
B: It’s your turn! I went last night.
A: Fine! Hello widdle baby! Why are you crying wid-
dle baby? Oh, I see, you made a doo-doo!
B: What’s going on hun? Why is the baby crying?
A: The widdle baby made a doo -doo!
B: What a good boy! Lets get this icky diaper off you.
A: Looky what I have here! Mickey Mouse jammies!
oopsie-daisy! Did the widdle baby just tinkle all
over daddy?
B: Yes he did! Yes he did! You just made a wee wee
all over daddy!
A: Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.
C: What going on in here?
A: Oh look it’s nana! Say hi to nana!
C: He’s so adorable! I could just eat him up!
A: Ok, say bye to nana! Time to go beddy - bye!
M: Okay, so, they are obviously new parents. They’ve just had a baby, so they’re excited 
about him waking up and… they’re all excited about the baby and how he wakes up and 
everything. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Uh, but an interesting thing, the baby was sleeping in another room. 
E: In English speaking countries people have sort of two different opinions about how you 
should, um, sleep with your baby. You know, some people wanna have the baby in the bed 
with them, right? 
M: Uhu. 
E: But some people think “No, the baby should definitely sleep in its own room”. 
M: Okay, in another room and in a crib. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right, I think this is a very important issue, because many people consider that it’s a 
good thing for the baby to sleep with the parents and they feel safe… 
E: Uhu. 
M: And you can make sure the baby’s okay. 
E: And it’s easier for, you know, waking up to feed the baby and change its diaper. 
M: Exactly, and well, if the baby is sleeping with its parents, it might not wake up as much. 
E: Uhu, but other people think if you let the baby sleep with the parents, the baby will 
become kind of spoiled and… and not a very good baby. 
M: Right, it might become too dependent on the parents and, for example, if you ever 
wanna go out or leave the baby with a babysitter or when the baby starts maybe preschool 
or kinder garden, it might not be really independent. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, why don’t you tell us what you think? Do you think it’s a good idea to allow a baby to 
sleep with you or should it sleep in its own room? 
E: Yeah, you can tell us at our website englishpod.com where you can also ask any 
questions you have about the language in this dialogue. 
M: Alright, guys, so, we’ll see you there and until next time… 
E: Thanks for downloading and… Good bye! 
M: Bye!
