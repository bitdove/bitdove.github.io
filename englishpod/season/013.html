E: Hello everyone! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name’s Erica. 
M: And I’m Marco. 
E: So, Marco, how’re you doing today? 
M: I’m great! I’m really happy to be back, ready to deliver another great podcast for all our 
listeners. 
E: That’s right! And we’ve got an intermediate lesson today about spending money. 
M: Yeah, specifically, spending money in a company. 
E: That’s right, we’re going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes 
how they’re spending money. 
M: Right, and they’re actually looking at their profit and loss statement, so… 
E: Okay. 
M: That’s kind of interesting. 
E: Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and loss statement?  
M: Uh, yeah, sure! Well, all companies come out with a profit and loss statement every 
year or every three months and it’s basically a document that shows all the money that the 
company is spending and all the money the money that the company is earning. 
E: So, it’s a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much 
it… it spends. 
M: Right, so, in the end, basically, it’ll tell you we’re making money or we’re losing money. 
E: Okay, so, we’re gonna be listening to, uh, some people discuss a profit and loss 
statement in just a moment. But before we do that, it’s time for “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
M: Okay, great! So, today on our vocabulary preview we have two words for you, so, let’s 
take a look at the first one. 
E: Expenses. 
M: Expenses. 
E: Expenses. 
M: Expenses. 
E: So, expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly. 
M: Right, so, for example, in a company regular company expenses are salaries or office 
supplies or the phone bills, internet bills. 
E: Okay, and maybe in a household or a family your expenses might be your food, perhaps 
your transportation or your rent or your heating bills, so, these are all things you spend 
money on regularly. They’re expenses. 
M: Expenses, great! Let’s take a look at our second word – through the roof. 
E: Through the roof. 
M: Through the roof. 
E: Through the roof. 
M: So, when something is through the roof, it’s… 
E: Really, really, really, really high. 
M: Really high. Hehe. So, for example, we can talk about gas prices are through the roof 
lately.  
E: Yeah, that’s totally true. Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of 
months. 
M: So, when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high. 
E: That’s right, we typically use this word with numbers. It also gives you the idea that the 
number has risen really quickly. 
M: Yeah, exactly! Hehe. 
E: Okay, so, through the roof. 
M: Through the roof. 
E: Alright, Marco, do you think it’s time for the dialogue? 
M: Yup, let’s listen to the dialogue. As always the first dialogue is gonna be a little bit fast, 
so, it might be a little bit difficult, but… 
E: Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, because we will explain all the key 
language in a minute. 
A: OK, so now the last point on our agenda. Jill, let’s
go over the profit and loss statement.
B: Great. Well, the main issue here, as you can see,
is that our expenses are through the roof.
A: Let’s see... These numbers are off the charts!
What’s going on here!
B: Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on en-
tertainment and travel are out of control. Look at
these bills for example. Just this month we’ve paid
over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!
A: OK, thank you. I’ll look into it.
B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five
thousand dollars for spa treatments!
A: Thank you; that will be all. I’ll take care of it.
B: Look at this one sir, eight thousand dollars
were spent in one night at a place called ”Wild
Things”?!
A: OK, I get it!! Thank you for your very thorough
analysis!
 
E: Okay, so, this accountant, she is, uh, pretty thorough, hey? 
M: Hehe. She’s really persistent about her job and the manager apparently is a little bit 
embarrassed. 
E: Hm, I wonder why that could be. 
M: Hehe. Well, we’ll talk about that in a little while. Why don’t we take a look at our 
language takeaway for today? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: In today’s language takeaway we’re going to look at three words and the first word is 
expenditures. 
M: Expenditures. 
E: Expenditures. 
M: Expenditures. 
E: So, expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right? 
M: It’s pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference, so, why don’t we listen to some 
examples and see if we can understand? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: ??? to president I will increase expenditures on health and education by twelve per cent 
(12%). 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We really need to control our travel expenditures. From now on all managers will fly 
economy class. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Because of the rise in oil prices expenditures on food are higher than they have ever 
been. 
E: So, expenditures is the total amount of money that you’re spending on something. 
M: Right, that’s the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend 
money on. 
E: Okay, that’s really clear. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Our next word is out of control. 
M: Out of control. 
E: Out of control. 
M: So, when something is out of control, it’s… 
E: It’s crazy. 
M: Crazy, you can’t control it. 
E: Exactly, you can’t stop it. 
M: You can’t stop it, right. 
E: Out of control. 
M: Okay, great! Now, let’s take a look at our last word for today – go over. 
E: Go over. 
M: Go over. 
E: Go over. 
M: So, go over is a pretty simple word. Why don’t we listen to some examples, so we can 
understand go over? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there’re no mistakes. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Can you help me go over my presentation? I want to make sure it’s perfect. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Let’s go over these numbers one more time and make sure there’re no mistakes. 
E: Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means “look at carefully”. 
M: Yeah, or review. 
E: In English we often find simple little words, they fit together really well and you think 
“Oh, they’re so easy”. Like the word go, over. So easy. 
M: Hehe. Yeah. 
E: But it’s the way that they interact with each other that makes them… 
M: Or it makes you sound much better. 
E: Exactly, so, go over in this case, we might say, um “Let’s go over the lesson”. 
M: Let’s go over the lesson, yeah. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or… 
E: That sounds great. 
M: Yeah, that’s… and that’s more, uh, natural way of saying something like that. 
E: Okay, so, we’ve taken look at our language takeaways for today. I think it’s time to listen 
to the dialogue one more time. 
M: And this time the dialogue will be slower, so we can understand and listen to all the 
words we just talked about. 
A: OK, so now the last point on our agenda. Jill, let’s
go over the profit and loss statement.
B: Great. Well, the main issue here, as you can see,
is that our expenses are through the roof.
A: Let’s see... These numbers are off the charts!
What’s going on here!
B: Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on en-
tertainment and travel are out of control. Look at
these bills for example. Just this month we’ve paid
over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!
A: OK, thank you. I’ll look into it.
B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five
thousand dollars for spa treatments!
A: Thank you; that will be all. I’ll take care of it.
B: Look at this one sir, eight thousand dollars
were spent in one night at a place called ”Wild
Things”?!
A: OK, I get it!! Thank you for your very thorough
analysis!
 
E: Okay, so, I got it. 
M: Yeah, it’s clear now. 
E: Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue that I’d like to 
at now in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Great, so, today on fluency builder we have three words for you. Let’s start by looking at 
the first one – off the charts. 
E: Off the charts. 
M: Off the charts. 
E: Off the charts. 
M: So, this word is very similar to through the roof.  
E: Exactly, it also means really high. 
M: Right, so, let’s listen to some examples of how we can use off the charts in a different 
situation. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Excellent job Susan! Your sales are off the charts this year. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Our losses are off the charts! That’s it! No bonuses for anyone! 
E: So, Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof in these 
examples? 
M: Yeah, you can. Definitely, you can use off the charts or through the roof, both of 
them mean the same thing. 
E: Okay, so, two ways of saying really, really, really high. 
M: Really high. But they’re very commonly used in a business setting. 
E: Yeah, that’s true. Okay, so, this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell 
somebody that you’ll check something or you’ll investigate something. 
M: Right, and we heard it in our dialogue, so, let’s listen to the clip. 
Phrase 1: I’ll look into it. I’ll look into it. 
E: So, look into that that means I’ll check something. 
M: Yeah, I’ll see what’s happening. 
E: Yeah, does that mean you’re gonna take action? 
M: No, it doesn’t. 
E: Okay, so, I think we’ve got another word that does mean you’re going to take action. 
Phrase 2: I’ll take care of it. I’ll take care of it. 
M: So, this word means that you’re going to do something about it. 
E: I’ll take care of it. I will take responsibility. 
M: Exactly, so, I will do something about it. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I will investigate and I’ll do it. 
E: Yeah, ex… again, two great phrases – I’ll look into it; I’ll take care of it. 
M: Okay, so, now let’s listen to the dialogue a third time. It’s gonna be at its normal speed, 
but now you have all the tools you need to understand it a lot better. 
A: OK, so now the last point on our agenda. Jill, let’s
go over the profit and loss statement.
B: Great. Well, the main issue here, as you can see,
is that our expenses are through the roof.
A: Let’s see... These numbers are off the charts!
What’s going on here!
B: Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on en-
tertainment and travel are out of control. Look at
these bills for example. Just this month we’ve paid
over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!
A: OK, thank you. I’ll look into it.
B: The list goes on and on. Here, this is a bill for five
thousand dollars for spa treatments!
A: Thank you; that will be all. I’ll take care of it.
B: Look at this one sir, eight thousand dollars
were spent in one night at a place called ”Wild
Things”?!
A: OK, I get it!! Thank you for your very thorough
analysis!
 
E: Well, Marco, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company, especially a 
large company, is you get a lot of amazing benefits. 
M: Yes, when you are a manger or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of 
great things like… I don’t know, a private jet, maybe… 
E: Wow, that’s… that’s nice, hey? 
M: Hehe. Or, um, they… um, the company often pays for your house… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or for your car, they’ll give you a company car. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Um, they’ll pay for your kids or your children’s, uh, tuition for high school.  
E: So, there’re school fees. 
M: Yeah, yeah. 
E: Okay. 
M: And also I’ve heard about entertainment bonuses. 
E: Yeah, so, you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt and claim the expenses at 
work. 
M: Hah, those are some great benefits, right? 
E: So, Marco, I’m curious to know what our listeners’ expenses are. 
M: Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have, for example… 
E: Well, let’s see, my spending on coke zero has gone through the roof since we started this 
podcast. 
M: Hehe. Yes, you spend a lot of money on coke zeros every week, right? 
E: Uh, yeah, I probably have, uh… I don’t know, ten a week. 
M: Well, for examples, I spend, uh, a lot on DVDs each week. I usually buy two or three 
movies. 
E: That is off the charts. 
M: Hehe. That is off the charts for DVD spending. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, we want to know what you spend your money on, be sure to l… go into our 
community website and tell us what you spend money on.  
E: That’s right, you can find us at englishpod.com and Marco and I are always there to 
respond your questions and comments. 
M: Great, so, we’ll see you there and until then it’s… 
E: Good bye! 
M: Bye!
