M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you another great lesson for all of you, who are interested in 
shopping. 
E: Especially those of you, who are interested in shopping for a car. 
M: A car. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Exactly. So, we’re gonna give you some great language about describing a car or 
characteristics of a car. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And also some really interesting language for shopping. 
E: Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive. 
M: Yeah, like a car. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, before we listen to our dialogue let’s take a look at “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
M: On vocabulary preview today we’re brining two words. The first one is vehicle.  
E: Vehicle. 
M: Vehicle. 
E: Vehicle. 
M: So, again a vehicle is a machine, right? 
E: Right, a machine that carries people from one place to another. 
M: So, it’s important to say that a vehicle could be an airplane… 
E: A car. 
M: A car. 
E: A boat. 
M: Boat. 
E: Even a bicycle. 
M: Right. 
E: Yeah. 
M: That’s a vehicle. Our second word is sedan. 
E: Sedan. 
M: Sedan. 
E: Sedan. 
M: So, a sedan is a type of car. 
E: Exactly. It… it’s a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside. 
M: So, to make it more clear, most taxies are sedans. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: They have four doors. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Five people can fit in there… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Including the driver. Except taxies in Mexico. 
E: They’re not sedans? 
M: They’re little Beetles. 
E: Oh. 
M: The Volkswagen Beetles. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, those are not sedans. But, yeah, most, uh, countries have sedans as taxies. 
E: Yeah. 
M: To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan. 
E: Yeah, yeah. Maybe like, uh, a Volkswagen Getta is that a…. 
M: A Jetta, yeah… 
E: Yeah. 
M: A Jetta is the sedan. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Now, we could listen to our dialogue and it’s gonna be at a normal speed, the first time, 
but you don’t have to worry about it. 
E: We’ll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dialogue. 
A: Hi there, can I help you folks?
B: I’m just browsing; seeing what’s on the lot. My
daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know
how it is.
C: Dad! I’m sixteen already and I’m, like, the only
one at school who doesn’t have a car!
A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have
cars. Let me show you something we just got in:
a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual
airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for
a young driver.
C: Dad, I love it! It’s awesome! Can we get this one
please?
B: I see... What can you tell me about this one?
A: Oh, that’s just an old World War Two tank that we
use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan...
B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about
this tank.
A: Well, Sir, if you are looking for quality and safety
then look no further! Three inches of reinforced
steel protect your daughter from short range mis-
sile attacks.
B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?
A: It does not.
B: Well, I don’t know. Let me sleep on it.
A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?
B: I’ll take it!
C: Dad!
 
M: I think she’s really lucky. She’s… 
E: Really? 
M: She’s getting a tank to go to school. How awesome is that? 
E: Uh, I would be so embarrassed if I had to drive to school on a tank. 
M: That’s like the coolest car. 
E: Oh, you’re such a boy. 
M: Hehe. Alright, a surprising ending to, uh, relatively easy shopping day. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Uh, let’s take a look at some… language that we saw in our dialogue on “language 
takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: We have four words for you today. The first one is gas mileage. 
M: Gas mileage. 
E: Gas mileage. 
M: Gas mileage. So, gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or liter of 
gasoline. 
E: Well, you know, it’s interesting in some English speaking countries like Australia, New 
Zeeland, Canada, we use kilometers… 
M: Right. 
E: To measure distance. But we still talk about gas mileage. 
M: Uh. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I guess you can’t say gas kilomiliage. 
E: No. 
M: Or… or some like that. But, yeah, it’s… yeah, basically, how many kilometers or how 
many miles you can travel on a tank or on a liter or gallon of gas. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay. 
E: The next word is airbags. 
M: Airbags. 
E: Airbags. 
M: Airbags. 
E: These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there’s a crash. 
M: Right, so, that way you don’t hit your head against… 
E: Yeah. 
M: The steering wheel or… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Something like that. 
E: So, they protect you. 
M: Right, I’ve heard that Volvo has like eighteen airbags now in their cars. 
E: They are very safe cars, you know. 
M: Hehe. Like a big balloon. 
E: Aha. 
M: Okay, our third word today is brakes. 
E: Brakes. 
M: Brakes. 
E: Brakes. So, what are brakes? 
M: Brakes are little… What are breaks? Breaks are what make your car stop. 
E: Okay, so, that the little machines maybe that stop your car. 
M: Yeah, they’re on the wheels. 
E: Yeah. 
M: They make your car stop. 
E: Aha. 
M: You have brakes on your bike. 
E: Yes. 
M: On your car, etcetera. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Our last word today on language takeaway – reinforced. 
E: Reinforced. 
M: Reinforced. 
E: Reinforced. 
M: So, we have some examples of how we use reinforced, because it’s a little bit weird. 
E: Yeah, these will help you understand the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: So, I reinforced all the walls; there’s no way they’re gonna fall down. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: This plastic is reinforced with the glass, so it’s both light and strong. 
M: So, basically, anything that’s reinforced is made stronger. 
E: Perfect. 
M: Reinforced steel… 
E: Yep. 
M: Reinforced table. 
E: Aha. 
M: Anything. Okay. Great, so now we could listen to our dialogue again. You can practice all 
these words that we just talked about and we’ll come back shortly. 
A: Hi there, can I help you folks?
B: I’m just browsing; seeing what’s on the lot. My
daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know
how it is.
C: Dad! I’m sixteen already and I’m, like, the only
one at school who doesn’t have a car!
A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have
cars. Let me show you something we just got in:
a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual
airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for
a young driver.
C: Dad, I love it! It’s awesome! Can we get this one
please?
B: I see... What can you tell me about this one?
A: Oh, that’s just an old World War Two tank that we
use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan...
B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about
this tank.
A: Well, Sir, if you are looking for quality and safety
then look no further! Three inches of reinforced
steel protect your daughter from short range mis-
sile attacks.
B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?
A: It does not.
B: Well, I don’t know. Let me sleep on it.
A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?
B: I’ll take it!
C: Dad!
 
E: So, we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping. 
M: Right. 
E: Let’s look at these in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: The first one is I’m just browsing. 
E: I’m just browsing. 
M: I’m just browsing. 
E: I’m just browsing. 
M: This is a really useful phrase, because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask 
you “can I help you?” or… 
E: Yeah. 
M: “Are you interested in something?” 
E: Yeah. 
M: And you’re just looking, so… 
E: Yeah, you maybe… you don’t really wanna buy today. 
M: Right. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, you’re just “uh, I’m just browsing”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, then they’ll just leave you alone and… 
E: Yeah, they won’t bother you as much. 
M: Yeah, it’s a good, good phrase. 
E: Another good phrase. 
M: Sleep on it. 
E: Sleep on it. 
M: Sleep on it. 
E: Sleep on it. 
M: So, we have some examples of how we use sleep on it. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I don’t know if we should buy that house. It’s perfect for us, but it’s so expensive. 
B: Let’s sleep on it. 
Voice: Example two. 
C: Why don’t you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow? 
Voice: Example three. 
D: This is a bit more than what I can afford; let me sleep on it. 
M: To sleep on it means to… 
E: Like to think about it overnight. 
M: To think about it, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, maybe you wanna buy this really expensive car. 
E: But you need to think about it. 
M: Right. 
E: So, you’ll sleep on it. 
M: So… yeah. You go home, sleep on it, think about it twice and then make a decision. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, great words and great dialogue, so… 
E: Yeah, I love this dialogue. 
M: Yeah, it was… it’s kind of funny. So, we could listen to it again and then we’ll come back 
and talk a little bit about it. 
A: Hi there, can I help you folks?
B: I’m just browsing; seeing what’s on the lot. My
daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know
how it is.
C: Dad! I’m sixteen already and I’m, like, the only
one at school who doesn’t have a car!
A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have

B: Well, I don’t know. Let me sleep on it.
A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?
B: I’ll take it!
C: Dad!
 
E: So, Marco, have you ever driven a tank? 
M: Hehe. Well… 
E: I… I mean know you were in the army, so… 
M: Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, actually I did… I did drive, uh, a tank before. 
E: Really? 
M: A really… yeah, a really old one… 
E: Really? 
M: Kind of like a World War Two type tank. But, yeah, they’re really fun and interesting. You 
have… it’s not like driving a normal car. You have pedals and you have… 
E: So, there’s no steering wheel? 
M: No, no, no. You have, um, levers… 
E: Yeah. 
M: And, uh… what many people don’t know is that actually tanks are… manual transmission, 
so you have to change gears. 
E: Oh, really? 
M: And it’s really hard to change gears on those things. 
E: And what’s the gas mileage like on a tank? 
M: Hehe. I don’t know, maybe like five miles per gallon, well… 
E: Okay. 
M: They run on diesel… 
E: Aha. 
M: Witch is a different type of fuel, right? 
E: Yep. Okay, well, very cool. I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank. 
That’s pretty awesome. 
M: Yeah, well, it was… it was fun, definitely and… I hope I get to do it again some day. 
E: Alright. Well, uh, guys, have you ever driven a tank? 
M: Or a submarine or any type of, uh, armor vehicle. 
E: Yeah, tell us about it at our website englishpod.com. 
M: Right, we’ll be there to answer all your questions. I’ll also be there to maybe post some 
more crazy stories. 
E: Or some pictures of the tank or something. 
M: Yeah, maybe. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright guys, we’ll see you there… until then it’s… 
E: Good bye! 
M: Bye!
