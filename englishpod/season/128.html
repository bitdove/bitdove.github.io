M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 
C: And my name is Catherine and today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling 
conclusion to the, well, very popular, I must say… 
M: Very popular. 
C: Series I’m Sorry I Love You. 
M: That’s right, today is the finale, the final episode - Episode Ten. This is where it all 
ends, so what do you think is gonna happen? 
C: If I guess you’re just gonna get angry at me, cause I actually know how it ends, but let’s 
just say I hope that it ends well for ourprotagonists. 
M: There was a lot of controversy around it, because, you know, I wanted to know if people 
wanted a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected. I guess everyone wants a happy ending, 
right? 
C: Absolutely, so we’re gonna, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica 
and check out this dialogue one time. 
Gulam: Steven! Good to see you brother! How are
you? How was your trip?
Steven: It was fine. I’ve been better but, it’s great to
be home, I’ve missed you all! How’s mom?
Gulam: She’s great! All she ever does is talk about
you -her little boy that went to the United
States. You’re her pride and joy, you know
that?
Steven: Can’t wait to see her. And you? What’s new
with you?
Gulam: Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You’ll have
another nephew or niece soon!
Steven: That’s great! Wow! Congrats! You two are
great together, ya know. You have such a
beautiful family. I hope one day I can have
that.
Gulam: Of course, man! Come on! I mean, every-
thing was set here for you to marry Shalini!
You know, she’s still pining after you. I don’t
think she’ll ever get over you.
Steven: What are you talking about? I hardly knew
her! How could she be in love with me? I
couldn’t go through with it even though she
is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the
United States. I just hope Veronica is happy.
Gulam: Get over it! You’re home now. Everyone
here thinks so highly of you; there’ll be girls
throwing themselves at you. You can marry
anyone you want!
Steven: I don’t want to marry anyone! I want to
marry her! Don’t you understand?
Gulam: You are incorrigible.
Liliana: Steven! My baby how are you! I’ve missed
you so much!
Steven: Hey, mom! Great to see you!
Liliana: You look so thin! Didn’t those Americans
feed you? Come come, let’s have some
chai. By the way... There is a girl here wait-
ing for you.
Veronica: Hi Steven.
Steven: Veronica! How did you get here? How did
you know where I live? I waited for you at
the airport but you never showed...
Veronica: I also have some little secrets that I haven’t
told you about, but we can discuss that later.
I realized that I was just scared. Scared of
how much I love you and of the commitment
that marriage requires. I’m here now. Now
there is something I wanna ask you. Steven,
will you marry me?
Priest: I now declare you, husband and wife. You
may kiss the bride.
M: Alright, so, uh, they got married. 
C: Cough-cough. 
M: Well, you got married. 
C: We got married! I got married! 
M: Yeah. 
C: Wow, I should have called my mom. 
M: Hehe. 
C: That’s great. 
M: And not only did you get married, but you got married Bolliwood style with like… 
C: Bollywood! 
M: Music and everything nice, huh? 
C: And those weddings are like for days long. 
M: Hehe. I hope you, uh, enjoyed the… the finale of… of this, uh, story. 
C: Absolutely, I was glad to see that it was a happy ending, I have to say. If it’d been a sad 
ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed… 
M: Yeah. 
C: Because, well, Veronica and I… 
M: Hehe. You get along. 
C: We get along. 
M: Alright, so apart form this happy ending and this happy finale that we had, uh, we did 
look at a lot of great words and phrases, so why don’t we start now with “language 
takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
C: So the first couple of phrases we wanna talk about here have to do with maybe catching 
up and talking about family or… 
M: Right. 
C: A gossip, because we’re talking to… 
M: A family member. 
C: Steven’s Indian family. 
M: Right. 
C: Whom he hasn’t seen for a long long time. 
M: Uhu. 
C: And the first thing he’s… he’s talking to his brother about his brother and his wife, so 
Gulam and Nisha are expecting, we find out. 
M: Right, they’re expecting. So if Gulam and Nisha are expecting, what does that mean 
exactly? 
C: Mm, they’re expecting a letter? 
M: Expecting a baby, maybe? 
C: Aha, yeah, so here we go. 
M: Hehe. 
C: I’m expecting is a very common English way of say “I’m going to have a baby”, “I’m 
pregnant”. 
M: Alright, so don’t get this confused. If somebody says “Oh, well, I’m expecting”, you don’t 
have to say “Expecting what?” 
C: Exactly, when it’s only expecting, when it’s not a thing afterwards, I’m expecting means 
I’m pregnant or she’s expecting – she’s gonna have a baby. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Uhu. 
M: So they’re expecting a baby. Or they’re expecting. Well, and they were talking about, 
well… Steven, he… he was supposed to get married in India and, uh, his brother said a very 
interesting word, he said well, “These girls are still, uh… this girl is still pining over you.” 
C: So this Shalini – some girl that Steven used to… to know when he was living in India. 
She’s pining after you. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Well, pine has many different meanings in English. 
M: Right. 
C: But in this sense we’re talking about having a crush on or being in love with. 
M: And also it’s a way of saying that you are… that you desire, youyearn for this person 
very, vey much. 
C: But they… you don’t have them. 
M: Right. 
C: You want them. 
M: You want them, so you’re pining over this person. Now, can you pine over an object? 
C: No. 
M: No. 
C: No. 
M: Usually it’s maybe, uh, related to love or to… and a person, right? 
C: Yeah, so she… she stands by the door everyday waiting the letter that doesn’t come, 
she’s pining away for her dear love Tomas or whatever. 
M: And you know what I read recently is that people can get addicted to pining. 
C: Really? 
M: Yeah, after a break up maybe you can pine after a person, not because you miss them 
or you want to… you kind of grow accustomed to it and you become addicted to this pain, 
that’s kind of pleasurable. 
C: Mm, there is a way to… describe, this is called Petrarchan Love. Well, it’s this kind of 
traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that’s never consummated, that’s never 
filled… 
M: Uhu. 
C: You’ll never get to be with the person that you love, that you desire. 
M: Mm. 
C: And so it’s a way… it’s a way of, uh, distinguishing the two different kinds of love: one 
where you with the person and the other where you always want them, but you can never 
have them. 
M: Hehe. Well, for you… hopefully none of our listeners are piningover anyone or get to 
experience that, huh? 
C: Exactly, but, uh, if you do pine away or if you pine aftersomeone, um, you have to 
hope that one day you’ll get over that person. 
M: Yeah, you have to get over it and that’s what his brother says “Hey, get over it”. 
C: I don’t think she’ll ever get over you. 
M: So what does that mean when you’re supposed to get over someone? 
C: Okay, this is a good question, because, you know, we’re talking here not about actually 
getting up on top of a fence or a wall. 
M: Hehe. 
C: We’re taking about emotions, so… 
M: Right. 
C: Getting over someone, so… I have to get over him… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Means that I have to stop feeling so sad about what… what happened, right? Because 
usually you say this one someone sad or angry. 
M: And…and also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know 
like… 
C: Uhu. 
M: Get over it. 
C: We’re gonna move on here to the last word in today’s language takeaway which 
is incorrigible. 
M: Okay, an incorrigible person. 
C: Alright, incorrigible. What could this mean? Well, let’s look at the sentence where we find 
it: you are incorrigible. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Gulam says this to Steven. 
M: Right, so, it’s an adjective and basically it means that you have no correction of some 
sort. 
C: Well, there’s an argument between Steven and Gulam. So they’re brothers and Steven 
says “I don’t wanna get married, I don’t wanna married here”, ah-ah-ah. 
M: Hehe. 
C: He’s complaining and his brother says “You’re incorrigible!” 
M: Uhu. 
C: You just won’t stop. 
M: Right. 
C: So someone’s… someone’s feelings, their emotions, their ideas about something, they 
just can’t be changed or… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Or altered, they’re fixed. 
M: Uhu. 
C: You know, this guy, he’s like “I’m not gonna get married” and his brother says “Ouh, 
you’re incorrigible”. 
M: Hehe. So… 
C: I just can’t change your mind. 
M: It’s kind of like being stubborn. 
C: Yeah. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Yeah, exactly. And we hear this phrase a lot, um, together, soyou’re incorrigible. 
M: Right. 
C: Right, so this is often just kind of, uh… it’s a f… it’s not an insult, but it’s a way for us to 
kind of be sarcastic or to make fun of someone. 
M: Uhu. 
C: You’re incorrigible, Marco. 
M: Hehe. Alright. 
C: Usually, it’s saying when you’re ???, you know, you’re being nice or fine. 
M: Yeah, alright. 
C: Uhu. 
M: Okay, cool, so five great words in language takeaway today and, well, before we move 
on and listen to the dialogue again, why don’t we take a look at “fluency builder”? 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
C: Alright, this first phrase is something that parents often use and grandparents as well. 
M: Mm. 
C: Because obviously parents and grandparents, they have proud of their children and 
grandchildren. 
M: Uhu. 
C: So they describe something as being their pride and joy. 
M: Uhu. My pride and joy. So it’s, uh, usually a person that's your pride and joy. 
C: I could be a thing too. 
M: It could be a thing. 
C: His Porsche Boxter is his pride and joy. He goes out every morning and he washes it… 
M: Uhu. 
C: He changes the oil, he checks the gas, he checks the tires, so it’s his pride and joy. 
M: Alright. 
C: It’s his most valued possession. 
M: So it always goes together, right? My pride and joy. 
C: Pride and joy, yeah. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Just think of it as a phrase – pride and joy. 
M: Alright. 
C: So, um, I’m my mother’s pride and joy. 
M: I think you are. 
C: Mm. Hehe. 
M: Alright, so… 
C: You don’t know my mom. 
M: Well… Alright, so… so somebody’s pride and joy. So now another phrase that we took a 
look at and it’s a way of making conversation especially with a person that you haven’t seen 
in a while. He said, hey, what’s new with you? 
C: What’s new with you? 
M: Aha, what’s new with you? 
C: Alright, so this might sound a little strange, because normally we would say “How have 
you been? It’s been a long time”. 
M: How are you? 
C: But this is like, you know, it’s… it’s a fluency builder phrase, so it’s very colloquial, it’s 
very spoken language. So this you hear often between friends… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Or family members. Hey, Marco, what’s new with you? 
M: So how do you… I would answer this by saying “Oh, well, not much” or, uh, “Oh, I just 
bought a new house”, so, basically, you’re asking for news. 
C: Yes… 
M: From a person. 
C: I haven’t seen you for a long time, you look… you look happy and healthy, so what’s new 
with you? Oh, I got married, I got a new car. 
M: Uhu. 
C: These things that you can say these are changes in my life, uhu. 
M: Alright, and usually after somebody asks you what’s new with you, you say something 
and then you usually would follow up and ask that person as well, right? What’s new… And 
what’s new with you? 
C: Exactly, so, you know, I got a new house, got a new job, what’s new with YOU? 
M: Yeah. 
C: Yeah. 
M: Or what about you? 
C: What about you? So it’s a nice, very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in 
their life. 
M: Perfect, alright, what’s new with you? Uh, what else? Now, he was supposed to get 
married, right? 
C: Right, so this is news: he was supposed to get married, he didn’t get married. What’s 
going on? His brother, his mother, they all wanna know what’s going on and we find out 
that wedding, that girl, he justcouldn’t go through with it. 
M: Uhu, so I can’t… I couldn’t go through with it. 
C: Okay, this is past tense, so he’s saying before I came to India with this girl I couldn’t go 
through with it. 
M: Uhu, so present would be I can’t go through with it. 
C: Mm, and going through with what? Here we’ve got it, so this kind of magical… 
M: Right. 
C: Strange word it, what it… what could this be? 
M: So basically, what he’s saying is that he couldn’t complete or maybe finish something 
that he started, right? 
C: So in this case we’re talking about… 
M: Marriage. 
C: A relationship… 
M: Or marriage. 
C: Or marriage. 
M: Yeah. 
C: Uhu. 
M: Or relationship. 
C: So… maybe we loved each other, but I couldn’t go through with it, I couldn’t go to the 
finish line. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Uhu. 
M: Right, I can’t get married. You see that a lot when maybe in movies two people are 
supposed to get married, they’re at the altar and all of a sudden the bride says “I can’t” or 
she goes away crying. 
C: I can’t go through with this. 
M: Exactly, right. 
C: Hehe. 
M: So, because she loves somebody else, so can’t go through with it. 
C: Mm, great, so a really good phrase – I can’t go through with it, he couldn’t go through 
with it. 
M: Alright. 
C: And, uh, we find out that, well, not such a bad thing, Steven is very popular in India, the 
girls love him. We’ve got a great phrase for describing of having lots of girls who love you. 
M: Hehe. Right, he says there’ll be girls throwing themselves at you. 
C: Literally like… 
M: Hehe. 
C: Ouh, that might have hurt. 
M: I can’t imagine that like just somebody throwing themself at you? 
C: Hehe. 
M: No, it’s not literal; it’s basically saying girls are very interested in you, girls are so 
interested in you that they’ll be chasing you almost. 
C: Alright, so many, many girls, they will… they will follow you, they want to be in a 
relationship with you, they like you. 
M: Uhu 
C: So he’s saying “Listen! There are other girls”. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Don’t worry. 
M: Right. 
C: Girls here, they love you. 
M: And it doesn’t only work with girls, right? I can say they’ll be boys throwing themselves 
at you. 
C: Right, so this is, uh… this is something we say about both genders - boys and girls. You 
could say “Oh, god! All the boys were throwing themselves at her, I’m so jealous”. 
M: Hehe. Right, so, but it’s only basically in a loving way, right? It can’t be anything else 
like somebody’s chasing you for other reasons. 
C: No, this is saying that they have pressures, they have feelings, they wanna be romantic. 
M: Alright. 
C: It’s not like… it’s not a bad thing, but sometimes it’s too much attention, so it can be kind 
of negative. 
M: Yeah. Alright, well, interesting phrases on fluency builder today. I think it’s time for us to 
listen to this dialogue for one last time. 
C: Get up and dance! 
M: Yeah, get up and dance and we’ll be back in a little bit. 
Gulam: Steven! Good to see you brother! How are
you? How was your trip?
Steven: It was fine. I’ve been better but, it’s great to
be home, I’ve missed you all! How’s mom?
Gulam: She’s great! All she ever does is talk about
you -her little boy that went to the United
States. You’re her pride and joy, you know
that?
Steven: Can’t wait to see her. And you? What’s new
with you?
Gulam: Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You’ll have
another nephew or niece soon!
Steven: That’s great! Wow! Congrats! You two are
great together, ya know. You have such a
beautiful family. I hope one day I can have
that.
Gulam: Of course, man! Come on! I mean, every-
thing was set here for you to marry Shalini!
You know, she’s still pining after you. I don’t
think she’ll ever get over you.
Steven: What are you talking about? I hardly knew

couldn’t go through with it even though she
is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the
United States. I just hope Veronica is happy.
Gulam: Get over it! You’re home now. Everyone
here thinks so highly of you; there’ll be girls
throwing themselves at you. You can marry
anyone you want!
Steven: I don’t want to marry anyone! I want to
marry her! Don’t you understand?
Gulam: You are incorrigible.
Liliana: Steven! My baby how are you! I’ve missed
you so much!
Steven: Hey, mom! Great to see you!
Liliana: You look so thin! Didn’t those Americans
feed you? Come come, let’s have some

how much I love you and of the commitment

there is something I wanna ask you. Steven,
will you marry me?
Priest: I now declare you, husband and wife. You
may kiss the bride.
M: Aright, so, um, it’s over. 
C: Uh, sad. 
M: Ten… 
C: Sad, but sweet. 
M: Sad, but sweet, aha. Ten… well, we went from them meeting casually by a bike accident. 
C: Pah-pah-pah. 
M: Yeah, it… had nice music. Then it turned out… 
C: That's so romantic. 
M: That she was angry, they kind of broke up, they got back together. 
C: He was being strange with all of these secret trips to save people. 
M: Uhu. It’s a… it was interesting, we went a lot of different ways… 
C: She was pregnant, she wasn’t really pregnant, she got s… 
M: But doctor was stalking her. 
C: Stalker. 
M: Hehe. Yeah. 
C: He’s in the secret service. 
M: It was an interesting ride. 
C: Mm, very interesting, but… 
M: Well, now we need to, uh, think of a new, um, drama, a new, uh soap opera or novel, 
so, um, we need your input. 
C: Maybe we should open it up. What did you like? What didn’t you like? And what kind 
of genre… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Are you interested in? Because, you know, there’s tons of different kinds of stories we 
could tell. 
M: Right, maybe we can do, um, something scary like a thriller or horror. 
C: I’m a big fan of sci-fi. 
M: Yeah, or sci-fi, maybe we can do something sci-fi. 
C: Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh.
