M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re gonna be talking about the weather. 
E: That’s right, and, you know Marco, this is a really, really useful and important topic in 
English, isn’t it? 
M: Exactly, because if you ever travel abroad, you always wanna know about the weather, 
right? 
E: That’s right, and Anglo people… English people, all they ever do is talk about the 
weather. 
M: Well, it’s an important topic; you wanna know what clothes to wear or if you should take 
an umbrella. 
E: Or even when you’re making small talk with people. 
M: Exactly, so, we’re gonna be taking a look at the weather in the United States, but before 
we get started with the dialogue, let’s take a look at “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: Okay, so, we have two words we’re gonna hear in the dialogue. Now, the first one 
is forecast. 
M: Forecast. 
E: Weather forecast. 
M: So, this is what we listen to or what we see on the television - theweather forecast. 
E: Right, it’s like the prediction of the weather. 
M: Okay, so, forecast. Can I only use it in the weather? 
E: No, of… of course, you can use it in many other different situations like in business, for 
example – forecast sales. 
M: Okay, so, the prediction of sales. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Very good, and we have one more word on vocabulary preview – ashower. 
E: A shower. 
M: Shower. 
E: Shower. So, when it… when it rains for a short p… time and it’s now too heavy, that’s a 
shower. 
M: Okay, very good, so, it’s very similar to a… shower at home. 
E: Right, it doesn’t… 
M: It… a little bit of water… 
E: And it doesn’t last too long. 
M: Okay… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Very good. So, why don’t we listen to our dialogue now? We are gonna be listening to 
the weatherman as he describes the weather in Utah. 
A: ...And now, let’s go to Kenny Williams for today’s
weather forecast.
B: Thank you Bill, and good morning Salt Lake City!
A: What’s the weather looking like today, Kenny?
B: Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today; we’ve
got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah, and
we’re calling for scattered showers throughout the
day, with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.
Now, if we move down to the south of the state,
we can see that a cold front is moving in. We
can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold,
with temperatures hovering around the thirty de-
gree mark.
A: It’s a chilly day folks, so don’t forget your coats!
What about tomorrow Kenny? Do you have good
news for us?
B: Well, it’ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah; we can
expect some isolated downpours in the morning.
Winds will be coming in from the North East, with
gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour. Salt
Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in
the evening. Things are looking a bit better for
the South; we’ll see cloudy skies with a chance of
showers. Later in the day, we can expect partly-
cloudy skies, with a forecast high of thirty-eight
degrees.
A: You heard it folks! It’s gonna be a cold one!
B: That’s right Bill. We will have more later on to-
day on the six o’clock news. That’s the weather
forecast for this morning.
M: Alright, so, we listened to the weather forecast and it doesn’t seem like nice weather in 
Utah, ha? 
E: No, it certainly doesn’t. Uh, I don’t think that I would really, uh, like to live there. 
M: Hehe. Well, maybe it’s winter or something like that. 
E: Well, I guess m… yeah, maybe it’s good for skiing. 
M: Okay, so, now I think it’s time for us to take a look at some of those maybe difficult 
words, that we may have listened to in this dialogue, in “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Alright, here we’re gonna look at some words and phrases that you can use to describe 
the weather. Now, the first one – we heard in the weather forecast that they were calling 
for scattered showers. 
M: Scattered showers. 
E: Scatter. 
M: Scattered. If something is scattered… 
E: It’s sort of like, um… it’s a little bit of that thing everywhere. 
M: Okay, so, and we already talked about what showers were. 
E: Right, so, s… shower is, uh, a small bit of… a small amount of rain. 
M: Okay, very good. To better understand when something is scattered, imagine that we 
are in a playground and the children are playing in the playground. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, the children are scattered everywhere; some of them are playing on the swing, 
some of them are playing, uh, on the grass or in the sandbox. So, children… a little bit of 
children in every different spot. 
E: So, if we think that the city is a playground, um, maybe in one part of the city there’s a 
little bit of rain, but not in the other part. 
M: Exactly. 
E: That’s a scattered shower. 
M: Very good! Moving on to our second word – we have hovering. 
E: Hovering. 
M: Temperature’s hovering around the thirty degree mark. 
E: The temperature is hovering around. 
M: Okay, so, when I say the temperatures are hovering… 
E: You mean it’s approximately… 
M: Okay, so, they can move up and down, so, maybe it’ll be a little bit warmer than thirty 
degrees or a little bit colder. 
E: Yes! So, if you think of hovering as floating. 
M: Okay, very good! So, why don’t we listen to some more examples of how we could use 
hovering in different situations? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Unemployment rates are hovering around the ten percent mark despite the government's 
attempts to stimulate the economy. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: The waiter has kept hovering around us all night; it was really annoying. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The company’s margin this year is hovering around the forty percent mark. 
E: Okay, so, pretty clear, hovering is sort of floating around one area. 
M: Very good. Now, let’s move on to the next part. We saw that we’re gonna have isolated 
downpours. 
E: Isolated downpours. 
M: Isolated downpours. 
E: Okay, let’s break this one down. Um, let’s start with downpour. 
M: A downpour is when you have a lot of rain, very strong rain. 
E: That’s right, for maybe a short amount of time it’s really raining heavily. 
M: Right, so, that’s what a downpour is. And if we take a look at the first word – isolated… 
E: So, in one small area. 
M: Okay, confined to a specific area. 
E: That’s right. 
M: Okay, so, we have an isolated downpour - it’ll be raining in one specific area. 
E: And you hear this a lot with weather language. You s… hear isolated showers, isolated 
snowstorms. 
M: Exactly, so, it’ll be in a specific area only. 
E: Alright, so, along with the… these showers and rain, we also talked about wind and… and 
we heard that we will have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour. 
M: So, we’re gonna have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour. 
E: Gusts of wind. 
M: Okay, so, can you explain, uh, to our listeners what gusts are? 
E: Okay, so, a gust is a sudden increase in the amount of wind. 
M: Okay, so, maybe we will have normal wind and… and all of a sudden it will get really 
windy. 
E: That’s right, for a short amount of time. 
M: Okay, that’s a gust. 
E: G-U-S-T, gust. 
M: Gust of wind. And for our final word on language takeaway today we’re gonna 
have sleet. 
E: Sleet. 
M: Sleet. 
E: Alright, sleet is a terrible kind of weather, it’s sort of a mixture between snow and rain. 
M: So, sleet is kind of this strange mix between ice and… and rain and snow. So, just 
imagine, it’s not completely ice, so it’s not solid. 
E: Uhu. 
M: But, it’s not water, right? It’s not rain. It’s something… 
E: And it’s not snow either. 
M: No, it’s in the middle. 
E: Okay. 
M: Alright, so, sleet. 
E: But what you really need to know is that it’s terrible. 
M: Haha. Alright, so, that’s all the words we have today for language takeaway. Let’s move 
on now to “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: Alright, on fluency builder today we’re gonna look at three phrases that are really 
common when you’re talking about the weather. Now, we heard in the dialogue that there 
was a cold front moving in. 
M: A cold front moving in. 
E: A cold front is moving in. 
M: Okay, so, a cold front. 
E: Imagine a wall… 
M: Uhu. 
E: Of cold air. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Um, and it… and it comes towards a place and then it changes the pressure in the 
atmosphere. 
M: Okay, so, uh, very sudden amount of… of cold air that comes into a place. 
E: Right. 
M: So, we say a cold front is moving in. 
E: Uhu. So, we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as… as moving. So, you can 
either say they’re moving in or you can say a cold front is coming in. 
M: Okay, very good, and… okay, we have a cold front that’s moving in and we’re gonna 
have winds that will be coming in from the North-East. 
E: Okay, winds coming in from. 
M: Okay, winds coming in from. So, when I say it’s coming in from… 
E: You’re talking about its origin, where it starts. 
M: Okay, so, if I change the noun and I say… and I don’t say winds anymore, but maybe I’ll 
say “my friends”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: My friends are coming in from… 
E: Chicago. 
M: Chicago, so… 
E: Yeah. 
M: They are arriving from Chicago. 
E: Exactly. 
M: What else can I say? 
E: Or you can also say “the kids are coming in from outside”. 
M: Okay, so, where they were before. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Very good, so, coming in from, you can change the noun a little bit and you can form 
these new sentences. 
E: Great! Now, our final phrase – we heard the announcer say “it’s gonna be a cold one”. 
M: It’s gonna be a cold one. 
E: It’s gonna be a cold one. 
M: So, I have this phrase “it’s gonna be a cold one”; what do I mean by a cold one? 
E: Okay, so, the one represents the event, so the day, right? 
M: Okay, so, it’s gonna be a cold day. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay. 
E: Now, we can obviously change the adjective, right? So, it’s gonna be a hot one; it’s 
gonna be a long one – it’s gonna be a long day. 
M: Alright. 
E: But we… the one can mean anything. 
M: Okay, so, it can be a day, it can be, uh, an event. 
E: Meeting. 
M: Okay. 
E: A project. So, for example, if we’re going to a meeting, I might say “hey Marco, this is 
gonna be a hard one”. 
M: Okay, so, the m… the one represents the meeting. 
E: That’s right. 
M: This is gonna be a hard meeting. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Alright, I think this is a very good phrase and it’s very commonly used. So, why don’t we 
listen to some more examples of how we can use it’s gonna be a something one? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Temperatures are forecasted to hit 37 degrees today; it’s going to be a hot one, 
folks! [NOTE: 37 degrees here is in degrees Celsiuswhereas in the dialogue the 
temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheitas used in the USA] 
Voice: Example two. 
B: It’s only 8 a.m. and I’ve got a hundred e-mails already; it’s gonna be a long one today! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I haven’t studied at all for the exam; it’s gonna be a tough one. 
M: Okay, so, some great examples and I think it’s time for us to listen to this dialogue again 
and now we can understand all these words and phrases that we’ve just talked about. 
A: ...And now, let’s go to Kenny Williams for today’s
weather forecast.
B: Thank you Bill, and good morning Salt Lake City!
A: What’s the weather looking like today, Kenny?
B: Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today; we’ve
got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah, and
we’re calling for scattered showers throughout the
day, with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.
Now, if we move down to the south of the state,
we can see that a cold front is moving in. We
can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold,
with temperatures hovering around the thirty de-
gree mark.
A: It’s a chilly day folks, so don’t forget your coats!
What about tomorrow Kenny? Do you have good
news for us?
B: Well, it’ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah; we can
expect some isolated downpours in the morning.
Winds will be coming in from the North East, with
gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour. Salt
Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in
the evening. Things are looking a bit better for

degrees.
A: You heard it folks! It’s gonna be a cold one!
B: That’s right Bill. We will have more later on to-
day on the six o’clock news. That’s the weather
forecast for this morning.
E: Okay, so, we know that in English speaking countries the weather is always, always, 
always a great subject of conversation for small talk, right? 
M: Exactly, if you ever wanna talk to somebody or start a conversation, the weather is 
always a number one topic. 
E: Yeah, and we actually have a phrase in this dialogue that’d be great for starting a 
conversation like, for example, imagine if you lived here in Utah, and you were, you know, 
wanting to start a conversation with someone, you could say “it sure is a cold one today, 
isn’t it?” 
M: Exactly, that’s a great way of staring a conversation and English speaking people love to 
talk about the weather as you say. 
E: That’s right, so, guys, if you have any questions about weather vocabulary or if you 
wanna practice talking about the weather, come to our website at englishpod.com.
