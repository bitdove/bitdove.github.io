M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you the next part of our suspense series The new guy in 
town. 
E: That’s right. 
M: So, we know that Armand wasn’t really a vampire, that he was just acting. 
E: And the women aren’t quite what they seem in this dialogue. 
M: In the last one something happened and she transformed into some sort of, I don’t 
know, creature, right? 
E: B… Monster. 
M: Right, so now, let’s see what happens. So, we’re not gonna preview any vocabulary this 
time, let’s just listen to the dialogue and see what happens. 
A: What the heck is going on! Did you see that?
What was that thing?
B: I don’t know! I’m just glad we made it out! Look,
there is a police car! Help! Help! Please stop!
C: Howdy man. What seems to be the problem? Is
this man bothering you?
A: Officer, officer, there is, like, a witch creature back
there! We tied her up but she broke free, and she
was about to have us for dinner!
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please. Have you been drinking tonight,
son?
B: We are telling the truth! She’s in there! We sus-
pected her of being a kidnapper or rapist but it
turns out she’s an alien or something.
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please...
B: Ugg! Seriously! Are you gonna help us or not?
C: Okay, let’s go have a look, shall we? Hello? Is
anyone in here?
A: Be careful! She might be hiding!
C: It’s perfectly safe... there isn’t anyone...
 
E: Well, I don’t think things are turning w… out very well for our housewives and Armand. 
M: Hehe. Apparently, the police officer is not gonna make it… 
E: Oh-oh. 
M: To the next episode. 
E: Oh-oh. 
M: Alright, so, we saw some really great vocabulary and even though it’s kind of a scary 
story, there is a lot of things we can learn. So, why don’t we take a look at it now in 
“language takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: We’re gonna look at five words and phrases here and the first one, uh, they described 
this women as a kind of creature. 
M: Creature. 
E: Creature. 
M: Alright, so, what exactly is a creature? 
E: Well, a creature can be any animal. 
M: Any animal? 
E: Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird… to an insect or a bug. 
M: So, I can say a bird is a flying creature. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Alright. 
E: But sometimes we also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal. 
M: So, there’s a creature under my bad. 
E: Yes, or some type of creature was attacking me! 
M: Hehe. Okay, so, a creature can be any sort of living thing… 
E: Exactly. 
M: Or animal. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, what about our next one? 
E: Well, the creature broke free from some ropes. 
M: Alright, so, to break free. 
E: Break free. 
M: Aha, and what does that mean? 
E: When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving. 
M: Okay, so, you have the ability to move again. 
E: Yes. 
M: You break free from maybe ropes. 
E: Or chains, or even a relationship. 
M: Okay, so… 
E: Yeah. 
M: I can say “Oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship”. 
E: Uhu. Now, that’s quite interesting, the way we can use this in different ways. So, why 
don’t we take a look at some examples now? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: We tied up the dog, but he’s trying to break free. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’m glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities. 
M: Okay, so, break free. It’s clear now. 
E: Uhu. So, why don’t we move on to our next word? They though that maybe this creature 
was a kidnapper. 
M: Kidnapper. 
E: Kidnapper. 
M: Okay, so, this is… 
E: A criminal. 
M: So, a kidnapper is a criminal. 
E: Yep. 
M: Alright. And what exactly does a kidnapper do? 
E: A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will. 
M: Against their will. 
E: With force or violence. 
M: Alright, so… so, I guess that makes sense, right? Because the word has “kid” in it… 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, to take children. 
E: Yes. 
M: But it can be also… you can kidnap an adult. 
E: Yes, that’s true. 
M: Alright. 
E: So, this word can actually be used in three different ways. So, we saw a kidnapper, 
right? 
M: Okay, that is the person. 
E: Yeah, and the verb - to kidnap. 
M: Okay. 
E: Or a noun describing an action – a kidnapping. 
M: A kidnapping. 
E: So… 
M: Very good. 
E: Yeah, a kidnapping took place today. 
M: Okay, so, very interesting word and, of course, it’s illegal to be a kidnapper. 
E: Yes. 
M: So, our next word is also very serious and it’s also a crime, right? 
E: That’s right. Rapist. 
M: A rapist. 
E: Rapist. 
M: Okay, so, that is a person that… 
E: Uhu, who forces someone to have sex. 
M: Okay, so, again, against their will… 
E: Right. 
M: Like a kidnapper. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, and the verb would be… 
E: To rape. 
M: To rape. 
E: To rape someone. 
M: Okay, so, on the lighter side we heard the police officer say something in a very 
strange way. He said “Lemme see you eyes, please”. 
E: Okay, so, this is an interesting, uh, phrase, it’s… it’s a sound made from pushing two 
words together.  
M: Right, so, lemme. 
E: Why don’t we hear a few more examples of this and see if we can figure out what are the 
two words? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Lemme have a look inside the car. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Lemme go out tonight, dad, please! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Lemme think about it and I will give you an answer tomorrow. 
M: So, basically, “lemme” is… 
E: Let me. 
M: Let me. 
E: Yeah. Lemme have that pen. 
M: Okay, lemme see. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, we do this also with other words, right? 
E: Yeah, another example would be gimme. 
M: Gimme. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, that is “give me”. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, so, an interesting thing. It’s not proper English, right? 
E: No, you wouldn’t really write it this way, but… 
M: Or find it in the dictionary. 
E: But it’s really common when people speak and actually it’s more likely that you’ll say 
“lemme”, “gimme”, than “let me”, “give me”. 
M: Okay, very good. So, I think now it’s time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second 
time and then we’ll come back and look at some other phrases that we saw in our dialogue. 
A: What the heck is going on! Did you see that?
What was that thing?
B: I don’t know! I’m just glad we made it out! Look,
there is a police car! Help! Help! Please stop!
C: Howdy man. What seems to be the problem? Is
this man bothering you?
A: Officer, officer, there is, like, a witch creature back
there! We tied her up but she broke free, and she
was about to have us for dinner!
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please. Have you been drinking tonight,
son?
B: We are telling the truth! She’s in there! We sus-
pected her of being a kidnapper or rapist but it
turns out she’s an alien or something.
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please...
B: Ugg! Seriously! Are you gonna help us or not?
C: Okay, let’s go have a look, shall we? Hello? Is
anyone in here?
A: Be careful! She might be hiding!
C: It’s perfectly safe... there isn’t anyone...
 
M: We’re gonna look at two phrases now in “fluency builder” that you might hear when 
you’re talking about a crime. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: So, the first phrase that we’re gonna look at is what the heck is going on. 
E: What the heck is going on. 
M: What the heck is going on. 
E: Okay, so, this is just asking what’s happening, right? 
M: Right, but it’s a very strong way of saying what’s happening. 
E: Yeah. What really is happening. 
M: Aha, now, why do they say what the heck? What is heck? 
E: Well, heck is sort of a polite of saying hell. 
M: Okay, so, instead of saying what the hell is going on… 
E: What the heck is going on. 
M: Now, why do you do this? 
E: Um, because in… especially in American English, uh, we don’t like to talk about religious 
words, so like… 
M: Uhu. 
E: Hell and God and Jesus – these things are, um, impolite in American English. 
M: Right, you don’t wanna offend anyone. 
E: Right. 
M: So, that’s why we would have other words like “oh, my gosh”. 
E: For “oh, my God”. 
M: Or Jeez. 
E: Instead of Jesus. 
M: Right. Okay… 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, that is an interesting thing and, of course, it’s… it is a little bit of a sensitive topic… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Among some people, so, that’s why it’s better to just use these synonyms. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay. And what about our next phrase? 
E: So, they suspected her of being a kidnapper. 
M: Okay, so, suspected her of being a kidnapper. 
E: Yeah, suspect someone of being something. 
M: Something. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, I suspect she is an alien. 
E: Right. I suspect him of being a liar. 
M: Okay, so, what about to suspect? What does that mean exactly? 
E: To think something that is true, but not be a hundred percent sure. 
M: So, you can say “I think she is a kidnapper”. 
E: Yep. 
M: Or “I suspect her of being a kidnapper”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Interesting. 
E: Why don’t we hear a few more examples? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: The police suspected him of being a bank robber. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs. 
M: Alright, very good, so, we’ve seen a lot of vocab, we’ve seen these phrases. So, I think 
it’s time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back and talk a 
little bit more. 
A: What the heck is going on! Did you see that?
What was that thing?
B: I don’t know! I’m just glad we made it out! Look,
there is a police car! Help! Help! Please stop!
C: Howdy man. What seems to be the problem? Is
this man bothering you?
A: Officer, officer, there is, like, a witch creature back
there! We tied her up but she broke free, and she
was about to have us for dinner!
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please. Have you been drinking tonight,
son?
B: We are telling the truth! She’s in there! We sus-
pected her of being a kidnapper or rapist but it
turns out she’s an alien or something.
C: Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your
eyes please...
B: Ugg! Seriously! Are you gonna help us or not?
C: Okay, let’s go have a look, shall we? Hello? Is
anyone in here?
A: Be careful! She might be hiding!
C: It’s perfectly safe... there isn’t anyone...
 
E: Okay, well, Marco, we’re coming near the end of this series, aren’t we? 
M: Yes, exactly. It’s a short series, but what do you think happens… or how do you think the 
series ends? What is really going on? 
E: A mystery here at EnglishPod, so we want you… to hear from you what do you think is 
gonna happen.

questions, your comments or even maybe your ideas not only for this lesson, but for any
