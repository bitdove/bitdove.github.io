M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you our great suspense scary series. 
E: Our thriller. 
M: Our thriller, Ney Guy in Town, Part 4. 
E: Alright, well, I don’t wanna give you any hints about what will happen in this dialogue. 
M: Yes, it’s totally unexpected, so… So let’s listen to our dialogue and then we’ll come back 
and talk about some of the great vocabulary. 
A: All right, drag her over here, and help me tie her
up.
B: I can’t believe she fell for it! She is a lot more
gullible than I thought!
A: Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant!
B: Whatever. I was the one that convinced her to
come. Look, she’s waking up!
C: What’s going on? Ellen? What are you doing?
A: The cat’s out of the bag, you witch! You can stop
pretending, now!
B: Yeah Lois , we know who you are! Now, we want
some answers! Why are you here?
C: Fools! You don’t know who you’re dealing with!
You can’t stop me!
B: Run!
 
E: Well, I certainly didn’t see that one coming. 
M: I know, everyone thought that Armand was a vampire… 
E: I know! 
M: And now it turns out that they were acting. 
E: Yeah, crazy. 
M: Crazy, ha? 
E: Strange things happen here on EnglishPod. 
M: Hehe. Alright, So why don’t we take a look at some of the language that we saw, in 
“language takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: We have three words for you here that, ah, we heard in the dialogue, um, and the first 
one, Armand tells Ellen to drag her over here. 
M: Right, drag. 
E: Drag. 
M: So, when you drag something or somebody… 
E: You pull them across the floor or pull them across the ground. 
M: Pull them… but you don’t actually pick them up, right? 
E: No. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah, this ther… their body is still touching the ground. 
M: Okay, so, just imagine if you have a really heavy suitcase, it doesn’t have any wheels. 
E: Uhu. 
M: You gotta drag it across the floor 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right? 
E: I’ve been there. [NOTE: I've been there = I’ve done it before, I’ve come across it 
before] 
M: Hehe. Yeah, it’s happen to me too. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, drag. 
E: Alright, and then he says, tie her up. 
M: Tie her up. 
E: Tie somebody up. 
M: Uhu, so to tie somebody up… 
E: To use rope and put it around a person, so that they cannot move. 
M: Right, so you take rope, you tie a person up, so… and it’s always used like, right? Tie 
somebody up. 
E: Yes... 
M: Tie him up. 
E: Tie that up. 
M: Tie that up. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. And our last word… 
E: I like this one, fools. 
M: Fools. 
E: Fools. 
M: So, or singular would be fool. 
E: Yeah, F-O-O-L. 
M: So, what’s a fool? 
E: Well, a fool is a stupid person. 
M: Right, a person that doesn’t know… 
E: Yes. 
M: Something or… 
E: Yeah. 
M: An ignorant person. 
E: Uhu, alright, well, Lois thinks that Armand and Ellen are fools here. 
M: Exactly, apparently she got really angry and… and managed to escape… 
E: Yes. 
M: From the chair or whatever what she was tied up, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: Well, the dialogue was a little bit fast, it wa… there was a lot of, ah, sound effects as 
well. 
E: Yep. 
M: So, let’s listen to this dialogue again, we’re gonna slow it down a little bit and I’m sure 
it’s gonna be a little bit easier to understand. 
A: All right, drag her over here, and help me tie her
up.
B: I can’t believe she fell for it! She is a lot more
gullible than I thought!
A: Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant!
B: Whatever. I was the one that convinced her to
come. Look, she’s waking up!
C: What’s going on? Ellen? What are you doing?
A: The cat’s out of the bag, you witch! You can stop
pretending, now!
B: Yeah Lois , we know who you are! Now, we want
some answers! Why are you here?
C: Fools! You don’t know who you’re dealing with!
You can’t stop me!
B: Run!
 
E: Well, Marco, I noticed in this dialogue there’s a lot of, um, words and phrases that we 
can use to talk about lying or fooling somebody. 
M: Exactly, there is a lot of language about lying, so let’s take a look at it in “fluency 
builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Alright, so in fluency builder today let’s take a look at four phrases. The first one, fell 
for it. 
E: Fell for it. 
M: I can’t believe she fell for it. 
E: Fell – For - It. 
M: Okay, so it’s not that she physically fell, right?  
E: No, no. 
M: Okay. 
E: But she believed the lie. 
M: She believed the lie. 
E: Uhu. 
M: You fell for the lie. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I know that we have some examples, so we can understand this phrase fell for it a little 
bit better. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: He might seem like a nice guy, but don’t fall for it, he’s a jerk. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I can’t believe I fell for your lies. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I told my mom I was going to a library and she fell for it. 
E: Alright, well, that’s a lot clearer to me.  
M: Uhu. 
E: I noticed how we have the preposition “it” here. 
M: Yeah, “it” is at the end. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And it’s referring to the lie. 
E: Yes. 
M: Or the joke. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Or the story. 
E: Yeah. 
M: She fell for the story. But you wouldn’t say she fell for the story, you would say she 
fell for it. 
E: So, these three words always always always go together. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Fell – For – It. 
M: Uhu. 
E: So don’t forget the “it”. 
M: Don’t forget the “it”. Okay, let’s take a look at our second word, gullible. 
E: So, Ellen thinks that Lois was gullible. 
M: Right, a gullible person. 
E: Yeah, gullible. 
M: A gullible person is… somebody that always believes…  
E: Yes. 
M: They… 
E: They always fall for it. 
M: They always fall for it. 
E: Yeah. 
M: They believe anything you say. So, I know you were a little bit gullible when you were 
younger, right? 
E: Yeah, it is true, um, you know, my grandmother used to tell me… every year she would 
say oh, I’m thirty five… 
M: Hehe. 
E: I’m thirty five, um, and I… I really believed her until I was about twelve years old.  
M: Wow. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, you were really gullible. 
E: I’m really gullible. 
M: But you’re not anymore. 
E: No, I know better. 
M: Hehe. Alright, so, gullible, a gullible person. Okay, now let’s look at our next phrase, the 
cat’s out of the bag. 
E: The - Cat - Is - Out - Of - The - Bag. 
M: The cat is out of the bag. Okay, so again it’s not literal, it’s not like you had a cat in a 
bag and… 
E: No. 
M: You let it out, right? 
E: Hehe. A nice idiom here meaning, ah, the truth is out. 
M: The truth is out, we discovered the truth. 
E: Yeah, so imagine that a cat is the truth.  
M: Right, and it… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Escaped. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, so the cat’s out of the bag, the truth is out, we know the truth now. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay. And our last phrase, pretending. 
E: Pretending. 
M: Pretending. 
E: So, Lois was pretending to be a normal housewife. 
M: Uhu. Let’s listen to some examples of how we would use pretending. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Pretend that you’re my boyfriend and he’ll go away. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I can’t believe Lucy pretended to be sick. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: You forgot my birthday. Don’t pretend that everything is okay. 
M: Okay, so pretending is acting like you’re somebody that you are not. 
E: Yes, or… Yeah it’s sort of like acting a lie. 
M: Okay, so, for example, on Halloween everyone dresses up as a monster… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Or Spiderman… 
E: Yep. 
M: Or something, so everyone pretends to be that character… 
E: Yes. 
M: But they are not. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, pretending, to pretend. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, so let’s listen to our dialogue one more time and then we’ll come back and talk 
some more. 
A: All right, drag her over here, and help me tie her
up.
B: I can’t believe she fell for it! She is a lot more
gullible than I thought!
A: Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant!
B: Whatever. I was the one that convinced her to
come. Look, she’s waking up!
C: What’s going on? Ellen? What are you doing?
A: The cat’s out of the bag, you witch! You can stop
pretending, now!
B: Yeah Lois , we know who you are! Now, we want
some answers! Why are you here?
C: Fools! You don’t know who you’re dealing with!
You can’t stop me!
B: Run!
 
M: Okay, so, what do you think will happen in part five? 
E: Um, I have no idea. 
M: Hehe. Well, what do you guys think will happen in part five? Apparently, Armand isn’t 
vampire anymore, ah… 
E: But Lois is a witch. 
M: But Lois is a witch. 
E: Who’s Ellen? 
M: Hehe. Ellen? 
E: What sort of twist are we gonna see here? 
M: Is she an alien? 
E: Oh my god. 
M: We don’t know what will happen, but you can tell us what you think will happen. Come 
to our website at englishpod.com and leave all your questions and comments and maybe 
your story ideas. 
E: Yes, Marco and I are always around to answer your questions, um, and to respond your 
comments, so… 
M: Okay. 
E: Guys, I think we’re out of time for today, but thanks for listening…  
M: And we’ll see you next time. 
E: Good bye! 
M: Bye!
