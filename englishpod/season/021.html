M: Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod! My 
name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful 
vocabulary. 
E: Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job. 
M: Yes, this is a really common situation when you… someone asks you what you do and 
you have to tell them. 
E: Exactly, so, today’s lesson is all about that. 
M: So, before we jump into our dialogue, let’s start with our “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have two simple phrases today that you’ll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary 
preview. The first one is VP. 
M: VP. 
E: VP. 
M: So, the VP of a company is… 
E: The Vice-President. 
M: The Vice-President, exactly. 
E: Yeah, simple little acronym. 
M: Right. 
E: And the next word is Fortune 500 (five hundred) company. 
M: Fortune Five 500 company. 
E: Fortune Five 500 company. 
M: So, a Fortune 500 company is… 
E: I’ll let you explain. 
M: Hehe. Well, Fortune Magazine ranks the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. 
E: So, a Fortune 500 company basically is… 
M: One of the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. 
E: Okay, that’s simple. 
M: Yep. 
E: Alright, well, with those words it sounds like we’re going to be talking to some important 
people today. 
M: Yes, we are gonna be talking to some important people, so, let’s listen to our dialogue 
for the first time. Now, it’s gonna be a little bit fast, but you don’t have to worry about it. 
E: Cause we’ll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary. 
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend.
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way.
B: Oh, man...
C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my
boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety
for a top Fortune 500 food company.
A: Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur.
B: Hey, how’s it going?
D: Hello.
A: Veronica talks about you all the time. I guess you
must be pretty busy at work.
D: Well, yeah, a V. P. position is not easy, you know! I
implement policies and procedures nationwide. of
various departments, as well as train junior man-
agers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to
oversee daily ope
B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting.
D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for
a living?
B: Oh, I’m a Top Gun pilot!
 
M: Alright, great music for our dialogue again, ha? 
E: Chosen by… 
M: By moi. Hehe. 
E: Of course. 
M: Yeah, Top Gun is one of my old time favorite movies and Top Gun pilot, what a cool 
profession? 
E: An excellent profession, much cooler than being like a VP. 
M: A VP. 
E: Yeah. 
M: How boring is it? 
E: Yeah, anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don’t you think? 
M: Yeah, you can tell a little bit of, uh, the sarcastic tone he had in his voice. 
E: Definitely, but he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now. 
M: Right, so, let’s take a look at “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Our first word for language takeaway is implement. 
M: Implement. 
E: Implement. 
M: Implement. 
E: Let’s listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Our company has to implement this sales strategy. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I implemented several new policies. 
M: Okay, great examples, and just in case to implement means to… 
E: Put into action 
M: To put into action, great. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Our second word for language takeaway – policies. 
E: Policies. 
M: Policies. 
E: Policies. 
M: So, policies are basically rules and regulations. 
E: Exactly, formal rules. 
M: For a company or an organization. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Policies, great. 
E: Third word… 
M: Oversee. 
E: Oversee. 
M: Oversee. 
E: Oversee. 
M: So, when you oversee operations, it means… 
E: Like you watch it to make sure it’s okay. 
M: You supervise it. 
E: This is an excellent word to use when you wanna talk about your job responsibilities. 
M: Right. 
E: Oversee. 
M: Uhu, great. And our last word for language takeaway. It’s kind of tricky, so, let’s listen 
to how it was used in our dialogue. 
Example: That alone means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. That alone 
means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. 
E: So, this guy has fifteen hundred (1500) employees under him meaning he supervises 
fifteen hundred employees. 
M: Right, he manages fifteen hundred employees. 
E: He must be a busy man. 
M: Yes! For fifteen hundred employees… How many employees do you have under you, 
Erica? 
E: Uh, two. 
M: Yeah, not quite as much as fifteen hundred. 
E: Yeah, because I’m not a VP ???… for yet, hey? 
M: Hehe. Not yet, but you will. 
E: Okay. 
M: Alright, so, with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time 
and this time it’s gonna be slower. 
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend.
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way.
B: Oh, man...
C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my
boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety
for a top Fortune 500 food company.
A: Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur.
B: Hey, how’s it going?
D: Hello.
A: Veronica talks about you all the time. I guess you
must be pretty busy at work.
D: Well, yeah, a V. P. position is not easy, you know! I
implement policies and procedures nationwide. of
various departments, as well as train junior man-
agers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to
oversee daily ope
B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting.
D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for
a living?
B: Oh, I’m a Top Gun pilot!
 
M: Okay, great stuff! With this, now we can start with our “fluency builder” for today. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue, some phrases that sound really 
natural, hey? 
M: Yes! Especially the first one that we have today is… Whenever someone talks and talks 
and talks and just… and continuously talks without stopping, you would say… 
Phrase 1: She’s always going on about him at the office. She’s always going on about 
him at the office. 
E: This is a really natural way of saying “keeps talking about”. 
M: Right, keeps talking about him. 
E: Yep, so, we have a few examples of how this phrase works. Let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: My boss is always going on about how we need to save money; it’s all he talks about. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Gary is always going on about his kids; he’s always talking about how smart they are. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: My mom is always going on about how I should get married. 
M: Okay, excellent! It’s clear now. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, so, let’s move on to our second phrase for today and this is a great one to use 
whenever you meet someone for the first time. 
E: Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time. 
M: Great. 
Phrase 2: Hey, how’s it going? Hello. Hey, how’s it going? Hello. 
E: So, this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying “How are you”. 
M: How are you? 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, yeah, you can just say “Hey, how’s it going?” 
E: Yep! 
M: Great. 
E: Really natural sounding. 
M: Now, our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue. 
E: Yes! 
M: And it’s a really common situation. 
E: When someone asks you about your job, they might say this. 
Phrase 3: Arthur, what do you do for a living? Arthur, what do you do for a living? 
M: So, this is a really great way of asking “What work do you do?” or “What is your job?” 
E: Yes, and now… I know a lot of students sometimes say “What is your job?” 
M: Yeah, and that is… well, it’s kind of correct, but not really. 
E: It doesn’t sound very natural. 
M: Right. 
E: So, you wanna use “What do you do?” or… 
M: “What do you do for a living?” 
E: Sounds great. 
M: That’s the way you ask someone what is their job. 
E: And that’s how you sound supper natural. 
M: Hehe. Okay, so, we’re ready now to listen to our dialogue a last time and now you are 
ready to understand everything. 
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend.
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way.

M: Okay, so, I have a little challenge for our listeners today. I have… 
E: What is it? 
M: Two challenges, actually. 
E: Okay. 
M: The first one – who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called? 
E: Okay, I don’t know the answer, so, I’m looking forward to seeing what users do. 
M: And the second one is what is the number one company in the Fortune 500? 
E: Oh, I also don’t know this answer.
