<pre>
M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you another great lesson about appointments. 
E: That’s right. We’ve got an elementary lesson about canceling an appointment. 
M: It’s a really common situation… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Sometimes you have an appointment at the doctor’s or something. 
E: Or at work. 
M: And you have to cancel it. 
E: Yes, so we’re gonna learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today. 
Let’s go straight to the dialogue then. We’re going to be listening as Samantha and Angela 
have a phone conversation and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment. 
M: And it’s gonna be a little bit fast in the beginning, but when we come back, we will 
explain all the great vocabulary. 
A: Hello, Samantha speaking.
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up?
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder,
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of.
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob-
lem...
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ...
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time?
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha?
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
M: Okay, we have some really interesting words that you’ve probably listened to in this 
dialogue, so… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Let’s start with “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Today on language takeaway we’re brining you three words. Ah, Erica, what’s the first 
one? 
E: The first word is reschedule. 
M: Reschedule. 
E: Reschedule. 
M: Reschedule. 
E: When you reschedule an appointment, you… 
M: Change it for another day or time. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Great, the second word that we have is inconvenience. 
E: Inconvenience. 
M: Inconvenience. 
E: Inconvenience. 
M: So, to inconvenience someone is to… 
E: To make things not convenient for that person. 
M: Hehe. Alright. So, to make things a little bit difficult… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or to make things a little bit, uh… 
E: Uncomfortable. 
M: Uncomfortable. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Inconvenience. 
E: And our third word is… 
M: Postpone. 
E: Postpone. 
M: Postpone. 
E: Postpone. We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand 
its meaning a little bit better. Let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’m sorry Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed. 
M: Okay, so, basically, postpone is to delay. 
E: That’s right. Make it at a latter time. 
M: At a latter time. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, some great words there and, ah, we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a 
slower speed. 
A: Hello, Samantha speaking.
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up?
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder,
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of.
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob-
lem...
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ...
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time?
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha?
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
E: Alright, so, in this dialogue we had some really great phrases that we should look at in 
“fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: We have three phrases for you today in fluency builder and the first one is so common, 
it’s a great phrase – what’s up? 
M: What’s up? 
E: What’s up! 
M: Hehe. So, this is a very common way of saying “hi”.  
E: Yeah. 
M: What’s up? 
E: How’s it going? What’s going on? 
M: Right, and now the interesting thing is it… th… many people don’t know how to answer 
this phrase. 
E: Yes, I see this all the time with my students. 
M: So, if you say “what’s up”, you should say… 
E: Not much. 
M: Not much. 
E: Nothing. 
M: Nothing. So, what’s up? 
E: Not much. Hehe. 
M: Not much. Hehe. Alright, so the next time someone’s tell you “what’s up”, now you know 
what to answer. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, our second phrase is can’t make it. 
E: Can’t make it. 
M: I can’t make it. 
E: We use this phrase when we want to say “I cannot attend”, I… 
M: I cannot make it. 
E: Yeah, I can’t come. 
M: Right, so, if you’re having a party today, I say “oh, I’m sorry, I can’t make it”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Ah, it means I can’t go. 
E: Exactly. Maybe one more example: so, Marco, we’ve got a meeting today at three 
o’clock. 
M: I can’t make it, I’m recording today. 
E: Oh, okay. 
M: Hehe. So, can’t make it. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Our last word for fluency builder – this thing came up. 
E: This thing came up. 
M: This thing came up. 
E: This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can’t make it… 
M: Right. 
E: ???. 
M: So… 
E: Uhu.  
M: I can’t make today, because this thing came up. Like something… 
E: Something happened. 
M: Something happened. 
E: Yeah. Let’s listen to a few examples of this phrase, so we can see how it’s used in the 
wild. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I’m sorry that I’m late, this thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I can’t talk right now, something came up. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Sorry I missed the meeting, something came up. 
M: Okay, great examples and I guess it’s perfectly clear now. 
E: Yes. 
M: So, let’s listen to our dialogue a third time and now we’re ready to understand 
everything. 
A: Hello, Samantha speaking.
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up?
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder,
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of.
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob-
lem...
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ...
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time?
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha?
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
M: So, Erica, have you ever canceled an appointment like this, uh, under false pretenses? 
[NOTE: or by false pretenses; doing something under/by false pretences means making 
sort of an intentional misrepresentation in order to obtain anything] 
E: So, for… for fake reasons? 
M: For a fake reason… to shopping. 
E: Um, well, I may not have… you know, told my boss “oh, I can’t make it to a meeting, 
because this thing came up” and then I really was going shopping… 
M: Uhu. 
E: I… I’ve never done that. 
M: Hm. 
E: But how about you, Marco? 
M: Well, you know in Ecuador soccer’s a really big thing. 
E: Right. 
M: So, um, when we were playing in the World Cup… Ecuador was playing and… 
E: Not you, but… 
M: Well, no like… 
E: Yeah. 
M: The… the Ecuadorian soccer team. 
E: Aha. 
M: I canceled an appointment, because I was gonna go watch the game. 
E: Really… 
M: Yeah 
E: A business appointment? 
M: A business appointment. 
E: Well, I guess that’s okay. 
M: Yeah, I mean it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and, you know, my 
boss didn’t really put up much of a fight, because I guess he also wanted to go watch the 
game. 
E: So, very similar to the… events in this dialogue. 
M: Very similar. 
E: Uhu. 
M: I guess that’s kind of the inspiration behind it.  
E: Alright, guys, I hope you found some these phrases helpful and useful. And remember if 
you have any questions about anything you heard in today’s lesson, please visit our website

M: Right, there you’ll be able to find more resources and also a large community to interact 
with. 
E: Yes, including me and Marco. 
M: Right. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, we’ll see you there, until then it’s… 
E: Good bye! 
M: Bye!
