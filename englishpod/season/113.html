M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod! My 
name is Marco. 
E: And I'm Erica. 
M: And today we are going to have a lesson that is going to be very useful when you arrive 
late. 
E: Yes, well, we all have arrived late to something and we need a good way of saying sorry 
and saying why we were late. 
M: So, today we're not only gonna be looking at vocabulary used to explain why you are 
late, but also some typical excuses of why people are late. 
E: Right, so, some normal reasons for saying why you're late. Well, why don't we get 
started with the dialogue? Now, we're gonna hear five people in the dialogue, so, at the 
beginning we'll hear the boss and the assistant and then we'll hear three people who are 
arriving late. 
A: Where is everyone? We were supposed to start
fifteen minutes ago!
B: Jo called and said she’d be here in a sec. She
said she got tied up with a client.
C: Sorry I’m late everyone. There was a huge traffic
jam on the highway this morning.
D: Morning everyone! Were you stuck in traffic as
well, Jess? There was a huge pileup on the high-
way and traffic was backed up for miles.
B: Scott just called and said that he’s running late.
His last meeting ran over, but he’s on his way now.
A: Guys, this is not acceptable. If I say the meeting
starts at ten, the meeting starts at ten. Not ten-
oh-one! And definitely not ten-ten! All right. Let’s
get started. So the first thing I want to talk about
is our...
E: I’m really sorry, everyone! I know I’m late. But
really, it’s not my fault. I was getting a coffee at
Starbucks, and the line was way too long. I was
waiting for twenty minutes to get my coffee!
M: Alright, so, well, good excuses, in general, except the last one. I don't think that's such a 
good excuse of why you're late, right? 
E: Yeah, I don't really think if I was the boss, I would be very happy with this employee. 
M: Yeah, I don't think coffee is that important. 
E: Hm, but some of the excuses were good and some of the language they used to describe 
the excuses was really great, so, let's look at that now in… in “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Alright, on language takeaway today we have four words that we're gonna be looking at 
and, well, let's get started with the first one. So, Jo called the office assistant and explained 
that she will be late, because she got tied up with a client. 
E: To get tied up. 
M: So, I got tied up with a client. 
E: Alright, this is a really common reason for being late, but why don't we listen to some 
examples to help us understand what it means. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Sorry I’m late, honey. I got tied up at the office. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I was tied up on the phone all afternoon and didn’t get any work done. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I got tied up in traffic on the way here. 
M: Alright, so, if you get tied up, it means that you get busy with something that you can't 
avoid. 
E: Right, you're busy with something that's so important, it's like you are tied by a rope to 
that thing. 
M: Okay, I got tied up. 
E: Mmm. 
M: I'm sorry I got tied up. 
E: Yep. 
M: Alright, now, the first person that arrived to the office, well, explained that there was a 
huge traffic jam on the highway. 
E: A traffic jam. 
M: A traffic jam. 
E: A huge traffic jam. 
M: Now, we understand traffic, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: Cars, a lot of cars. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, a jam, it means that it was like blocked. 
E: It was stopped. 
M: It was stopped. 
E: Yep. 
M: There were a lot of cars on the highway and they weren't moving. 
E: So, a huge traffic jam is a very, very big stopping of cars. 
M: Now, our next word explains why sometimes there is a traffic jam. 
The sound of a car accident. 
E: Well, we found out that there was a huge pileup. 
M: A pileup. 
E: A huge pileup. 
M: Okay, a huge pileup. Now, if a pileup is another way of saying anaccident, right? 
E: Yeah, an accident with many cars and they all get piled on top of each other. 
M: Alright, so, many cars got into an accident. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, this could be a reason of why there was a traffic jam. 
E: Uhu, and also a reason for why you are late. 
M: Oh, right, now, the other person Scott also called and he said that he's running late. 
E: He's running late. 
M: He's running late. 
E: I'm running late. 
M: Now, if I'm running late, th… Am I actually running somewhere? What am I doing? 
What's happening? 
E: You are going to be late and you know you're going to be late. 
M: Okay, I know I'm going to be late… So, I'll call you and I'll say “Hey, I'm running a little 
bit late”. 
E: Yeah, actually, this is the most common thing I say when I'm gonna be late. And I think 
it's really important, uh, to know how to use this phrase, so, let's hear some more 
examples. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Jane is running late, she’ll be here in ten minutes. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Traffic is really bad, so I’m running late. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I’m running a bit late, so, please start without me. 
M: Alright, perfect, so, running late – a very common way of explaining that you're going to 
be late and, well, it makes you sound very native. 
E: Yeah, it's a great phrase. Now, our last phrase what we heard - the reason why Scott 
was running late was because his last meeting ran over. 
M: Okay, to run over. 
E: My meeting ran over. 
M: Now, ran over, my meeting ran over, it means it went too far? 
E: Well, when something runs over, it goes longer. 
M: Okay, longer than expected. 
E: Yeah, so, a meeting can run over or, um, an appointment can run over. 
M: So, I can say “My meeting ran over fifteen minutes”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: I'm going to a little bit late. 
E: That's right, a great excuse. 
M: Very good, five great words and, well, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue 
and understand these words as they were used in the dialogue. And then we'll come back 
and take a look at more phrases. 
A: Where is everyone? We were supposed to start
fifteen minutes ago!
B: Jo called and said she’d be here in a sec. She
said she got tied up with a client.
C: Sorry I’m late everyone. There was a huge traffic
jam on the highway this morning.
D: Morning everyone! Were you stuck in traffic as
well, Jess? There was a huge pileup on the high-
way and traffic was backed up for miles.
B: Scott just called and said that he’s running late.
His last meeting ran over, but he’s on his way now.
A: Guys, this is not acceptable. If I say the meeting
starts at ten, the meeting starts at ten. Not ten-
oh-one! And definitely not ten-ten! All right. Let’s
get started. So the first thing I want to talk about
is our...
E: I’m really sorry, everyone! I know I’m late. But
really, it’s not my fault. I was getting a coffee at
Starbucks, and the line was way too long. I was
waiting for twenty minutes to get my coffee!
E: Okay, we['ve] got some… some more great phrases for describing being late. Let's look 
at them now in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: When Jo called, she said she'd be there in a sec. 
E: I'll be here in a sec. 
M: I'll be here in a sec. 
E: So, when someone will be here in a sec, it means they'll be here very soon, right? 
M: Okay, I’ll be here in a sec, I’ll be there in a sec. 
E: But what about this word sec? 
M: Uh, it's a short way of saying “second”. 
E: So, S-E-C. 
M: A sec. Now, it's an exaggeration obviously, because you won't be there in… in one 
second, but you're just explaining that you'll be there very, very soon. 
E: What about the difference between I’ll be here in a sec and I’ll be here in a minute? 
M: Well, if you say “I'll be there in a sec”, it means like “I'll be there in one minute”, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: But if you say “Oh, I'll be there in a minute”, it could be a minute or more, like three or 
four or five minutes. 
E: Yeah, I think that's true. 
M: Now, again, going back to this traffic issue, we saw that somebody was stuck in traffic. 
E: To be stuck in traffic. 
M: I got stuck in traffic. 
E: Now, when you're stuck in traffic, you can't drive, because there're too many cars 
stopped on a highway. 
M: So, you are actually in the traffic jam. 
E: Yeah, yeah, you're stopped there for like twenty minutes, you can't move. 
M: Okay, I'm stuck in traffic, I… I'm going to be late. 
E: Uhu, really great excuse! Um, and the reason they were stuck in traffic was because 
traffic was backed up for miles. 
M: Okay, traffic is backed up for miles. 
E: To be backed up for miles. 
M: Now, if I say the traffic is backed up for miles, it means that it's very long or how… how 
does that work? 
E: Well, okay, imagine there is an accident. 
M: Uhu. 
E: And that has caused a traffic jam and the cars are lined up for… for many miles behind 
you. 
M: Okay, so, it's backed up. From that point there're many miles of cars… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Waiting to pass. 
E: Yep. So, it's baked up for miles. 
M: Very good, so, great phrases and I think it's appropriate for us to listen to the dialogue 
for the very last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this being 
on time issue. 
A: Where is everyone? We were supposed to start
fifteen minutes ago!
B: Jo called and said she’d be here in a sec. She
said she got tied up with a client.
C: Sorry I’m late everyone. There was a huge traffic
jam on the highway this morning.
D: Morning everyone! Were you stuck in traffic as
well, Jess? There was a huge pileup on the high-
way and traffic was backed up for miles.
B: Scott just called and said that he’s running late.
His last meeting ran over, but he’s on his way now.
A: Guys, this is not acceptable. If I say the meeting
starts at ten, the meeting starts at ten. Not ten-
oh-one! And definitely not ten-ten! All right. Let’s
get started. So the first thing I want to talk about
is our...
E: I’m really sorry, everyone! I know I’m late. But
really, it’s not my fault. I was getting a coffee at
Starbucks, and the line was way too long. I was
waiting for twenty minutes to get my coffee!
E: Well, Marco, I know that ideas about time and ideas about being late are different in 
different countries. 
M: Yeah, in different countries people treat time or being on time in different ways. 
E: Yeah, like I'm from Canada and I look at being on time really different than you do, 
right? 
M: Hehe. Yes, because, for example, if you call for a meeting at nine (9) o'clock. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Usually, people will be there at 9 o'clock, because the meeting will start. 
E: In America. 
M: Right, in America. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, for example, in Latin America we do have this, what we call sometimes the Latino 
time. 
E: Okay. 
M: Or Hispanic time. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Which is like nine o'clock is like… the time that everybody should be there, but until 
people get there, get their coffee and whatever, than it'll be 9:15, maybe up to 9:30. 
E: And I think it's a little bit even more, um, noticeable when… when we're talking about 
social events. Like if you go to someone's house for… for dinner, in Canada if they say 
“Come to my house at six o'clock for dinner”, you'll be there at six-oh-five (6:05), right? 
M: Okay, yeah. Yeah, usually, you'll be there only a couple of minutes, uh… after the time 
that was specified, just to, you know, give the house owner a little bit of time. 
E: Yeah. 
M: But if we have a dinner invitation for six, we know that it's not really going to begin 
eating at six, so, people will get there at 6:30 or 7 and, of course, food isn't ready until like 
maybe 8 or 9. 
E: Hm, but I… but in German countries, from what I know, um, you've got to be there… if 
they say “Be there at six”, you're there at six-zero-zero (6:00), right? 
M: Hehe. 
E: Not six-oh-one (6:01). 
M: And also I think it's about, um, when people start work, right? 
E: Mm, yeah. 
M: How on time you have to begin work. Sometime it's acceptable to be ten or fifteen 
minutes so-called 'late', but in other places, you know… 
E: Yeah, in North America, if… if you're supposed to start work at nine, you have to be at 
your desk working at nine. 
M: At… at nine. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Yeah, see that in… in… in other countries people get there at nine, get their coffee, 
maybe take a quick glance at their e-mails… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or the newspaper and then, you know, start working at around 9:30 or 10. 
E: So, I guess the important thing is to know, um, what the tradition is in the country 
where you are. 
M: Exactly, so, come to our website englishpod.com and let us know how it works in your 
countries. I know that many different countries have a different way of treating time, so, 
share it with us. 
E: Yes, and remember if you have any questions, please ask them at the website as well. 
We're out of time today, but until next time, thanks for listening, and… Good bye! 
M: Bye-bye!
