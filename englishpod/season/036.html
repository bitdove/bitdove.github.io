M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you the Third Part of this series that we’ve created, called 
I’m Sorry, I Love You. 
E: That’s right, the third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple. 
M: Yeah, it’s a romantic series, but today we’re bringing you an argument. 
E: That’s right. 
M: Like in every relationship you have fights, you have discussions. So, we’re gonna teach 
you how to do that in English. 
E: That’s right, in today’s lesson you’ll learn some great language that people use when 
they get into an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend. 
M: Right, so, why don’t we take a look at “vocabulary preview”? 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have one phrase today – get a hold. 
M: Get a hold. 
E: Get a hold. 
M: To get a hold. 
E: To get a hold of someone means… 
M: To try and communicate with that person. 
E: Exactly. So, to try and call that person. 
M: For example, I can say “I’ve been calling his phone all day, but I can’t get a hold of him”. 
E: Or I could say “finally, Marco, I got a hold of you; where have you been all day?” 
M: Exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, we’re gonna listen to our dialogue and as always it’s gonna be at a normal pace, 
but you don’t have to worry about it. 
E: We’ll come back and teach you all of the important words. 
A: Steven! Where have you been? I’ve been trying
to get a hold of you for hours!
B: I... um... there was an emergency at work, so...
A: I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three
hours! And you didn’t even have the decency to
call me! Do you have any idea how embarrassed
I was?
B: Honey, I promise this won’t happen again, it’s just
that I...
A: Yeah, right. I’ve heard it all before. I’m not going
to take any more of your empty promises. This
is the 5th time you’ve stood me up in two weeks!
You need to get your priorities straight. I’m tired
of you putting your job first all the time!
B: Come on, Veronica, that’s not fair. I do care about
you a lot, you know that. I tried to ...
A: You know what? Maybe we should just take a
break. I need some time to think about where this
relationship is heading.
B: But...Veronica, would you just listen to me? There
was a fire alarm at my office building today and I
was stuck...
 
M: Okay, so, a little bit of trouble in the relationship. 
E: Yeah, that’s too bad. 
M: Yeah, well, I think, um, she’s overreacting. 
E: You do? 
M: Hehe. We’ll talk about that later on. But we saw some great words and phrases here, so 
it’s time for “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Today on language takeaway we’re bringing you three words. 
E: The first word is stood me up. 
M: Stood me up. 
E: Stood me up. 
M: Stood me up. 
E: The phrase stand someone up, when do we use this? 
M: If, for example, you have a date and you don’t go. 
E: Okay, so, let’s say you and I were supposed to have dinner together. 
M: Right. 
E: And you just didn’t come. 
M: Right, and didn’t… 
E: And didn’t call. 
M: Right, so, I stood you up. 
E: Yeah, okay. 
M: Stand someone up. 
E: Our next word – priorities. 
M: Priorities. 
E: Priorities. 
M: So, priorities are something that’s really important in your life. 
E: That’s right like family or maybe work or making a lot of money. 
M: Hehe. 
E: Or whatever it is. 
M: Wh… What are your priorities in life? Right? 
E: Right, yeah. 
M: Okay. And our last word for language takeaway – heading. 
E: Heading. 
M: Heading. 
E: Heading. This is a bit of a funny verb, so let’s listen to a couple of examples of how it’s 
used, so we can understand its meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I don’t know where our relationship is heading. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Where’s this bus heading? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Where’s this project heading? 
M: So, basically heading means going. 
E: Exactly. 
M: A heading is where you’re going. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, easy word and interesting. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, so now it’s time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time. It’s gonna be 
slower, so now we can understand the words that we just talked about. 
A: Steven! Where have you been? I’ve been trying
to get a hold of you for hours!
B: I... um... there was an emergency at work, so...
A: I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three
hours! And you didn’t even have the decency to
call me! Do you have any idea how embarrassed
I was?
B: Honey, I promise this won’t happen again, it’s just
that I...
A: Yeah, right. I’ve heard it all before. I’m not going
to take any more of your empty promises. This
is the 5th time you’ve stood me up in two weeks!
You need to get your priorities straight. I’m tired
of you putting your job first all the time!
B: Come on, Veronica, that’s not fair. I do care about
you a lot, you know that. I tried to ...
A: You know what? Maybe we should just take a
break. I need some time to think about where this
relationship is heading.
B: But...Veronica, would you just listen to me? There
was a fire alarm at my office building today and I
was stuck...
 
M: Okay, now, we saw some interesting phrases in the dialogue. 
E: Yeah, we saw some great phrases, uh, that people use when they’re getting in a fight. 
M: Right. Why don’t we take a look at some of them in “fluency builder”? 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: The first phrase that I wanna take a look at today is do you have any idea. 
E: Do you have any idea. 
M: Do you have any idea. 
E: This is a great way to set up an argument. 
M: So, let’s listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this 
phrase. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: You forgot my birthday. Do you have any idea how angry I am? 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Julie kissed my boyfriend. Does she have any idea how mean that was? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I just broke up with my boyfriend. Don’t you have any idea how sad I am? 
M: So, it’s a great phrase to make that person understand that you’re really worried or… 
E: Really angry. 
M: Really angry. 
E: Yeah, yeah. 
M: Okay. Another second phrase that you can take a look at is I’ve heard it all before. 
E: I heard it all before. 
M: I’ve heard it all before. 
E: I’ve heard it all before. 
M: So, this is a great phrase of just saying “you don’t have to give me an excuse; I know 
what you’re gonna say”. 
E: Exactly. 
M: And our last phrase today – take a break. 
E: Take a break. 
M: Take a break. 
E: So, when a couple takes a break, they sort of… stop their relationship, right? 
M: Right, they’re breaking up. 
E: Yeah, but it’s… is it really like forever? Like, uh, a break up that lasts forever? 
M: Not, well… maybe. It could be forever, but they’re saying let’s just take some time away 
from each other… 
E: Yeah. 
M: For a couple of days or weeks… 
E: Yeah-yeah. 
M: And see what happens. 
E: Yes, take a break. 
M: Take a break. Okay, so, our happy couple is going to take a break. 
E: Well, I guess they’re not that happy then, hey? 
M: Yeah. Hehe. Okay, so, let’s listen to our dialogue again and then we’ll come back and 
talk some more. 
A: Steven! Where have you been? I’ve been trying
to get a hold of you for hours!
B: I... um... there was an emergency at work, so...
A: I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three
hours! And you didn’t even have the decency to
call me! Do you have any idea how embarrassed
I was?
B: Honey, I promise this won’t happen again, it’s just
that I...
A: Yeah, right. I’ve heard it all before. I’m not going
to take any more of your empty promises. This
is the 5th time you’ve stood me up in two weeks!
You need to get your priorities straight. I’m tired
of you putting your job first all the time!
B: Come on, Veronica, that’s not fair. I do care about
you a lot, you know that. I tried to ...
A: You know what? Maybe we should just take a
break. I need some time to think about where this
relationship is heading.
B: But...Veronica, would you just listen to me? There
was a fire alarm at my office building today and I
was stuck...
 
E: So, Marco, this phrase to take a break really reminds me of a Friends episode. 
M: Yeah, that really famous Friends episode, when Ross and Rachel were on a break… 
E: And… 
M: And… 
E: And Ross like went with another girl, right? 
M: Yeah-yeah-yeah. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And then they definitely broke up after that. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, that’s one of the key issues, right? 
E: Right. 
M: If you’re taking a break, can you start to date someone else? 
E: I’ve got to agree with Rachel. 
M: Hehe. Really? 
E: Yeah. No, you can’t. You can’t. 
M: You can’t? 
E: Cause… 
M: So, what’s the point of taking a break? 
E: Just… you need some time away; you need some time to think. 
M: But you’re not really broken up. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Hm, that’s convenient. 
E: Hehe. 
M: I don’t know. They were on a break, I agree with Ross. 
E: Well… 
M: Hehe. 
E: You would, wouldn’t you? 
M: Alright guys, we’re out of time today. I hope you enjoyed our lesson and be sure to 
listen next time, because we will definitely have a part four of this. 
E: Yes. 
M: Coming out soon. 
E: Yep. 
M: And also come to our website at englishpod.com and leave all your questions and 
comments. 
E: Yeah, Marco and I are always happy to hear from you and we love answering your 
questions.  
M: Right, and maybe you can tell us what you think happens in the fourth part. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, well, until then it’s… 
E: Good bye! 
M: Bye!
