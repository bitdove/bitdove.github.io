M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today with Erica we’re bringing you a great lesson about time. 
E: We need more of it. 
M: We need more time, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, we’re gonna be teaching you how you can ask for more time. 
E: If you’re working on a project at work and you can’t finish it on time, you have to ask 
your boss for more time. 
M: Right, so, today in our dialogue Casey needs more time to put together a press kit. 
E: What’s a press kit? 
M: Good question. A press kit is something the marketing department will put together, 
basically, pictures, logos, um, all… information about the company. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them, so, they 
have something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or magazine. 
E: Okay. 
M: Okay, so, let’s listen to our dialogue for the first time and as always it’s gonna be at a 
normal speed, so, it might be a little bit difficult to understand. 
E: We’ll come back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language. 
A: So, Casey, how are things going with the photos
for the press kit?
B: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.
I might need to ask for an extension on that dead-
line.
A: You’ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why
are things delayed?
B: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. . .
A: I’m not looking for excuses here. I just want to get
this finished on time!
B: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some
things were just beyond my control. I had trouble
booking the photographer, and then Michael was
sick for three weeks, so I couldn’t include him in
the photos, and the design team lost all the files,
so I had to re-do the pictures.
A: I’m not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I
want those photos ASAP!
 
M: Alright, so, Casey is in trouble, I think. 
E: Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset. 
M: Yeah, well, let’s take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: First word today is deadline. 
E: Deadline. 
M: Deadline. 
E: Deadline. 
M: So, Erica, what’s a deadline? 
E: It is the last possible date to do something. 
M: So, for example, when we were in school… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Our teacher would send us homework and say it was for Friday. 
E: So, the deadline was Friday. 
M: Was Friday. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Right? Or when you’re at work you have projects that you have to finish by a certain 
date. That’s your deadline. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, let’s look at our next word – extension. 
E: Extension. 
M: Extension. 
E: Extension. 
M: So, extension and deadline go together, right? 
E: Exactly, if you can’t reach your deadline or you can’t make your deadline, you must 
ask for an extension.  
M: An extension. So, you ask for more time. 
E: Yeah, an extension is moving the deadline in the future. 
M: Alright, interesting. Let’s look at our next word – ran into. 
E: Ran into. 
M: Ran into. 
E: Ran into some problems. 
M: So, we ran into some problems in this dialogue. Let’s listen to some more examples of 
run into, so we can understand the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: We’ve ran into a storm on our way home. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: If you’re not careful now, you’re going to run into a lot of problems later. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I ran into some trouble with my computer. 
M: Okay, good examples, so, it’s clear now, right? 
E: Right, if you run into problems, you meet some problems. 
M: Right. Many students say it in that way “I met some problems”. 
E: Yeah, but that’s wrong. 
M: Right. So, you would say “I ran into some problems”. 
E: Right, “I met some problems” is wrong, wrong, wrong. 
M: Okay, don’t say “met some problems”. 
E: I ran into some problems. 
M: I ran into, okay. And our last word for language takeaway – delayed. 
E: Delayed. 
M: Delayed. 
E: Delayed. 
M: So, when something is delayed, it’s… 
E: Late. 
M: Late. 
E: And the opposite is… 
M: On time. 
E: Yeah, so, your flight was delayed. 
M: Or your flight was on time. 
E: The project was delayed. 
M: Or your project was on time. 
E: Clear. 
M: Alright. So, now let’s go back to the dialogue. Let’s listen to it again. 
E: And this time it’ll be a little bit slower, so you can understand some of these phrases we 
just talked about. 
A: So, Casey, how are things going with the photos
for the press kit?
B: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.
I might need to ask for an extension on that dead-
line.
A: You’ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why
are things delayed?
B: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. . .
A: I’m not looking for excuses here. I just want to get
this finished on time!
B: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some
things were just beyond my control. I had trouble
booking the photographer, and then Michael was
sick for three weeks, so I couldn’t include him in
the photos, and the design team lost all the files,
so I had to re-do the pictures.
A: I’m not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I
want those photos ASAP!
 
M: Okay, so, there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue. 
E: Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time. 
M: Okay, so, let’s look at these phrases in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Alright, what’s our first phrase? 
E: I’ve been meaning to talk to you. 
M: I’ve been meaning to. 
E: I’ve been meaning to. 
M: Okay, we have some really great examples of how you can combine I’ve been 
meaning to with different verbs. 
E: Yeah, let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I’m sorry I haven’t called you yet; I’ve been meaning to, but I’ve been busy. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’ve been meaning to tell you, but John quit yesterday. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I’ve been meaning to see that film for a while. 
M: I’ve been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven’t had time. 
E: So, you’ve been wanting to for a long time. 
M: Right. I’ve been thinking about it. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I’ve been planning to do it. 
E: But you just haven’t done it. 
M: I haven’t done it. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Maybe because I haven’t had time or money. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay. Good phrase. 
E: Our next phrase is… beyond my control. 
M: Beyond my control. 
E: It’s beyond my control. 
M: So, it means that I can’t control it. 
E: You can’t do anything about it. 
M: Can’t do anything about it. The weather is beyond my control. 
E: Right. Or relate with this project: because Jane was sick for one month, it was beyond 
my control. 
M: Okay. 
E: Uhu. 
M: It wasn’t you fault. 
E: No. 
M: Okay. And our last phrase for fluency builder – put this off. 
E: Put this off. 
M: Put this off. 
E: Put this off. 
M: So, let’s listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I’ve been putting off this project for a week and it’s due tomorrow! 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Can we put off our meeting to next week; I’m too busy right now. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I’ve been putting off my e-mail all day and now I have fifty messages to respond to! 
E: So, Marco, when you put something off, you… 
M: Leave it for later. 
E: Okay. 
M: Right? So, maybe I have to write a report today… 
E: Uhu. 
M: But I’m gonna put it off till tomorrow. 
E: So, you’re gonna do it tomorrow. 
M: I’ll do it tomorrow. Okay, so we’ve seen some great words and some really good 
phrases, so, now let’s listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back and 
talk some more. 
E: Uhu. 
A: So, Casey, how are things going with the photos
for the press kit?
B: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.
I might need to ask for an extension on that dead-
line.
A: You’ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why
are things delayed?
B: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. . .
A: I’m not looking for excuses here. I just want to get
this finished on time!
B: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some
things were just beyond my control. I had trouble
booking the photographer, and then Michael was
sick for three weeks, so I couldn’t include him in
the photos, and the design team lost all the files,
so I had to re-do the pictures.
A: I’m not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I
want those photos ASAP!
 
E: Well, Marco, do you think that Casey’s reasons for being late are good? 
M: I think so, because it wasn’t really her fault, the whole situation with, uh, photographer 
and then one of her coworkers was sick for three weeks. 
E: Yeah. 
M: It’s not really her fault, right? 
E: Right, but maybe the boss thinks that she’s making excuses. 
M: Yeah, maybe she’s making excuses. That’s really common like, for example, when we 
were kids, you would say “oh, you know, my dog ate my homework”. 
E: Right, but… that… really happened to me once. 
M: Hehe. Your dog ate your homework? 
E: My cat ate my homework. 
M: Your cat ate your homework. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And what did your teacher say? 
E: Well, actually I was a really good student, so, my teacher believed me. 
M: Hehe. Well, my teacher wouldn’t have believed me. 
E: Really? 
M: No, no, she would’ve… she would’ve called my parents most likely. 
E: Yeah, well, my… my cat really did eat my homework. And… I just left it on the table and 
it chewed it at all. 
M: That’s weird. Why would your cat do that? 
E: I don’t know. 
M: A lot weir excuses out there. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I was abducted by aliens. 
E: Aha. 
M: My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa. 
E: Really? 
M: Yeah, that was… 
E: Was it happen to you? 
M: Creative… 
E: Aha. 
M: Writing. 
E: Oh, Okay. 
M: Creative excuses. 
E: Well, I wanna hear from our listeners. I wanna know what excuses they’ve used for being 
late with something.
