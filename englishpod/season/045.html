M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you part four of our romantic series called I’m Sorry, I Love 
You. 
E: Yeah, and today we’ve got some drama, don’t we? 
M: We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language. 
E: Yeah, we’re gonna learn, um, some phrases we can use to describe a mistake. 
M: Uhu. 
E: And, uh, we’re also going to learn how we can comfort someone, we can make them 
feel better. 
M: Okay, exactly, so, in our dialogue today Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break. 
E: Right. 
M: So, what does it mean to be on a break? 
E: Well, it means you stop having a romantic relationship for a short time. 
M: So, you can say “We are on a break”. 
E: So, we’re not dating. 
M: We’re not dating. 
E: But… 
M: Oh… 
E: We don’t date. 
M: Oh… Hehe. Or we could say “Let’s take a break”. 
E: Right, so, we’ve got this state on a break and the action take a break. 
M: Take a break. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, let’s take a break. Okay, so, let’s listen to our dialogue and it’s gonna be a little bit 
fast and the girl, I think, she’s crying, so, it’ll be a little bit difficult to understand. 
E: But Marco and I will come back in a minute and we’ll talk about some of the difficult 
language here. 
A: ... so, I said, ”let’s take a break .” And since that
night, I’ve been waiting for him to call, but I still
haven’t heard from him. You don’t think he’s see-
ing someone else, do you?
B: Come on, don’t be so dramatic! I’m sure every-
thing is going to work out just fine.
A: You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me?
I’m sure he’s cheating on me! Why else wouldn’t
he call?
B: But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can
do whatever he likes.
A: He’s the love of my life! I’ve really messed this up.
B: Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It’s going to
be alright.
A: But I... I still love him! And it’s all my fault! I can’t
believe how immature and selfish I was being. I
mean, he is a firefighter, it’s not like he can just
leave someone in a burning building and meet me
for dinner. I’ve totally messed this up!
B: You know what, Veronica, I think you should make
the first step. I’m sure he’ll forgive you...
A: No, this is not gonna happen! I... I’ve ruined ev-
erything....
B: Hey... do you hear something? Guess what? It’s
your lovely firefighter!
C: When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong
dear. And since, since you went away, don’t you
know I sit around with my head hanging down and
I wonder who’s loving you.
 
M: Wow, that’s a romantic boyfriend singing in the street. 
E: Yeah, yeah, that’s amazing. Have you… Have you ever done that for a girl? 
M: Uh… no. Hehe. 
E: Hehe. Well, have you… have you ever sung to a girl on KTV. 
M: I’ve sung to a girl on KTV. 
E: And karaoke. 
M: Karaoke, yeah. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, but not so much as on… on the street with all the neighbors coming out to see me. 
E: Well, okay, well, I don’t blame you. 
M: Hehe. Alright, let’s take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue on 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Alright, so, let’s take a look at our first word – seeing someone. 
E: Seeing someone. 
M: Seeing someone. 
E: Seeing someone. 
M: So, if I’m seeing someone… 
E: You’re dating them. 
M: I’m dating them. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I’m frequently going out with that person. 
E: Right. 
M: So, but it’s not very serious. 
E: N… No… it is serious. 
M: But not really, it’s more of a casual thing. It’s not very exclusive.  
E: So… So, if you’re seeing someone, then you can also s… see another person. 
M: Maybe. 
E: Hm. 
M: Hehe. 
E: Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually they’re your boyfriend or 
girlfriend. Like, I’m seeing John, he is my boyfriend. 
M: Okay, yeah, see, this is the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people 
it means it’s really serious, while for other people it means it’s more casual. 
E: I guess it’s important that you and your boyfriend of girlfriend share the same view on 
the meaning of this word. 
M: Alright. Have to agree on what seeing someone means. 
E: Okay, well, what’s our next word, Marco? 
M: Cheating on. 
E: Cheating on someone. 
M: Cheating on me. 
E: Cheating on someone. 
M: Okay, so, if you’re cheating on someone… 
E: Then you are like kissing or even having sex with someone, who’s not your boyfriend or 
your husband, or your girlfriend or your wife. 
M: Exactly, so… 
E: Yeah. 
M: If I say “She cheated on me”… 
E: Uhu. 
M: That means that my girlfriend kissed of had sex with another guy. 
E: Right. 
M: But if I say “She cheated me”… 
E: Yeah, that’ different. 
M: That’s different, right? 
E: It’s different. Maybe she sold you something for a really high price. 
M: She cheated me. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or maybe she sold me something that was fake. 
E: Or, yeah… or broken or something. 
M: Or broken. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, so… 
E: So, cheated on is really different from cheated. 
M: Okay, let’s take a look at our next word – messed this up. 
E: Messed this up. 
M: Messed this up. 
E: Messed this up. So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb, um, and that means we can sort of 
switch it around a little bit, right? 
M: Exactly, why don’t we listen to some examples and then we can come back and talk 
some more. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I messed up on the examen and now I passed my class. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: When I’m cooking I always mess up and burn the rice. 
M: Okay, so, messed up, it’s pretty clear I think. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, let’s take a look at our next word – amateur.  
E: Amateur. 
M: Amateur. 
E: Amateur. 
M: So, when someone is amateur… 
E: They’re acting really young. 
M: Really young, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: But it’s not a very good thing to be amateur. 
E: No, it’s… it has a negative meaning. 
M: Right, it’s normal for children to be amateur. 
E: Cause they’re children. 
M: Right, but not an adult. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay. 
E: So, we’ve got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit 
better. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Your toilet jokes are not funny. Stop being so amateur. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Jenny acts like she’s sixteen. She’s so amateur. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: God, you and your friends always act so amateur. 
M: Alright, so, amateur. Now, let’s take a look at our next word – selfish. 
E: Selfish. 
M: Selfish. 
E: Selfish. 
M: So, a selfish person… 
E: Is a person, who only thinks about themselves. 
M: Okay, so, I only think about me. 
E: Uhu. 
M: No one else. 
E: Yeah, you don’t care about other people’s feelings. 
M: Okay. So, it’s not a good think to be amateur or selfish. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, so, I think it’s time for us to listen to our dialogue again. We’re gonna slow it 
down a little bit. 
E: And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly. 
A: ... so, I said, ”let’s take a break .” And since that
night, I’ve been waiting for him to call, but I still
haven’t heard from him. You don’t think he’s see-
ing someone else, do you?
B: Come on, don’t be so dramatic! I’m sure every-
thing is going to work out just fine.
A: You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me?
I’m sure he’s cheating on me! Why else wouldn’t
he call?
B: But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can
do whatever he likes.
A: He’s the love of my life! I’ve really messed this up.
B: Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It’s going to
be alright.
A: But I... I still love him! And it’s all my fault! I can’t
believe how immature and selfish I was being. I
mean, he is a firefighter, it’s not like he can just
leave someone in a burning building and meet me
for dinner. I’ve totally messed this up!
B: You know what, Veronica, I think you should make
the first step. I’m sure he’ll forgive you...
A: No, this is not gonna happen! I... I’ve ruined ev-
erything....
B: Hey... do you hear something? Guess what? It’s
your lovely firefighter!
C: When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong
dear. And since, since you went away, don’t you
know I sit around with my head hanging down and
I wonder who’s loving you.
 
M: Okay, so, we saw Veronica’s friend trying to calm her down, right? 
E: Yeah, trying to comfort her. 
M: Okay, to make her feel better. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Let’s take a look at some of the phrases she used in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Okay, so, what was the first phrase that she said? 
E: Everything is going to work out just fine. 
M: Everything is going to work out just fine. 
E: Everything is gonna work out just fine. 
M: What does that mean? 
E: It’s going to be okay. 
M: It’s going to be okay, right? 
E: Yeah, the problem will be solved. 
M: Okay, so, if somebody’s worried or somebody is crying, you… 
E: Yeah. 
M: You can say “Oh, don’t worry, everything is going to work out just fine”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay. Okay, let’s look at the next one - pull yourself together. 
E: Pull yourself together. 
M: Pull yourself together. 
E: Pull yourself together. 
M: So, what does that mean, exactly? It sounds kind of weird. 
E: I know, I guess it… it just means stop crying, relax and, you know, take a deep breath. 
M: Okay. Just like calm down. 
E: Yeah, yeah. 
M: Get organized. 
E: Yeah-yeah-yeah. 
M: With your ideas and your thoughts. 
E: Yeah. So, you can think of maybe somebody, who’s got tears down their face and 
everything is sort of in a mess. 
M: Uhu. 
E: If you pull it together, they clean up and they… 
M: Okay. 
E: They sort of relax, right? 
M: Okay. Pull yourself together. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Alright, and the last phrase that we saw – it’s going to be alright. 
E: It’s going to be alright. 
M: It’s going to be alright. 
E: It’s going to be alright. 
M: So, it’s going to be alright means everything is going to be okay. 
E: Yeah, it’s going to be fine. 
M: It’s going to be fine. 
E: The problem will go away. 
M: You… 
E: You’ll feel better. 
M: Maybe you can even say “It’ll be alright”. 
E: Yeah, yeah. 
M: It’ll be alright. 
E: Yeah. These are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you wanna say 
something nice to a friend or a colleague, who… who has a problem. 
M: Okay, exactly, very useful language. So, let’s listen to some more examples. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Don’t worry, everything is going to work out just fine. I’m sure he still loves you. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Everything is gonna be alright. We’ll find your puppy. Don’t worry! 
M: Okay, great examples and I think it’s clear now. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, let’s listen to our dialogue again and then we’ll come back and talk some more. 
A: ... so, I said, ”let’s take a break .” And since that
night, I’ve been waiting for him to call, but I still
haven’t heard from him. You don’t think he’s see-
ing someone else, do you?
B: Come on, don’t be so dramatic! I’m sure every-
thing is going to work out just fine.
A: You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me?
I’m sure he’s cheating on me! Why else wouldn’t
he call?
B: But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can
do whatever he likes.
A: He’s the love of my life! I’ve really messed this up.
B: Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It’s going to

A: But I... I still love him! And it’s all my fault! I can’t

C: When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong
dear. And since, since you went away, don’t you
know I sit around with my head hanging down and
I wonder who’s loving you.
 
M: Okay, I really like this dialogue. It’s so romantic. 
E: Yeah. 
M: It’s drama, but at the same time romantic. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, we want to know what you think will happen next? 
E: Yeah, will they get back together? 
M: Will they get married? 
E: Will the have a baby? 
M: Maybe they’ll break up for ever. 
E: Maybe she’ll move halfway across the world. 
M: Hehe. Anything can happen, so, let us know what you think will happen.
