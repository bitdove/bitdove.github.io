M: Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: Hey Erica, how are you today? 
E: Marco, I’m doing really well and I’m really looking forward to today’s lesson. 
M: Well, so am I, because here at EnglishPod we’re giving you real English. 
E: Everyday English. 
M: Exactly, English that you hear in movies or in TV-shows. 
E: This is English people actually use. 
M: So, Erica, what is our topic for today? 
E: Well, today we’re talking about computer viruses. 
M: Perfect! So, I think it’s time for us to take a look at our preview. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: Okay, today we’ve got two words to preview. The first word is virus. 
M: Virus. 
E: Virus. 
M: Virus. 
E: So, if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right? 
M: Actually, a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your 
computer. 
E: Oh, I see, okay… 
M: And… 
E: Well, thank you for being so technical. 
M: Hehe. That’s the technical explanation. Okay, let’s take a look at our second word for our 
preview today and that would be froze. 
E: Froze. 
M: Froze. 
E: Froze. 
M: So, if your computer froze, it means that… 
E: Your computer stopped working. 
M: Your applications or your programs stop working and you just can’t do anything. 
E: Your computer’s broken. 
M: Okay, great, so, let’s listen to our dialogue. It’s gonna be a little bit fast, but… 
E: Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything. At the end of this podcast you’ll 
understand everything. 
M: Perfect! Let’s listen. 
A: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again!
That’s the third time today! Hey Samuel, can
you come take a look at my PC? It’s acting up
again. It must have a virus or something.
B: Just give me a second; I’ll be right up.
B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns
out that you have a lot of infected files!
A: But I’m quite careful when I’m browsing the
internet, I have no idea how I could have picked
up a virus.
B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus
software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to
date, that’s probably what was causing your prob-
lems.
A: Ok. Anything else?
B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!
A: Um yeah… Sorry about that.
 
M: Well, I completely understand this guy. When my computer freezes I kick it and punch it 
and do everything to it. 
E: Well, I hope you don’t punch it too hard, Marco. 
M: Well, it’s still working, so it’s alright. 
E: Okay. 
M: Alright, let’s take look at our “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: In today’s language takeaway we have two words. The first word for today is infected 
file. 
M: Infected file. 
E: Infected file. 
M: Infected file. And what is an infected file? 
E: An infected file is a file in your computer that has a virus in it. 
M: Uh, perfect, that’s really clear! What is our second word for the language takeaway 
today? 
E: Our second word is not up to date. 
M: Not up to date. 
E: Note up to date. 
M: And what is it when something is not up to date? 
E: It means it doesn’t have all the most recent information. 
M: Okay, perfect! Now, let’s listen to some examples. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I need to buy a new computer, because mine isn’t up to date. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I can’t find this street. Are you sure this map is up to date? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Sarah has just finished the report and all the information is up to date. 
E: Okay, that was pretty clear. You know, you can also use this phrase positively. You can 
say up to date. 
M: Okay, for example, we can say “this is a new map, this the most up to date map”. 
E: Exactly, or if I bought a new computer, I could say “I just got a new computer, all my 
software is up to date”. 
M: Okay, great! So, now let’s take a look at some phrases. 
E: And it’s time for “putting it all together”. 
Voice: Putting it together. 
E: Okay, so, Samuel said a really great phrase. He said I’ll be right up. 
M: I’ll be right up. 
E: I’ll be right up. 
M: I’ll be right up. Now, we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations, so, let’s listen 
to some examples. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Can you help me with my computer? 
B: I’ll be right there. 
Voice: Example two. 
C: Come downstairs. Dinner is ready. 
D: I’ll be right down! 
Voice: Example three. 
E: Hurry up! I need to use the bathroom! 
F: I’ll be right out! 
M: Okay, really great and clear examples, right? 
E: Yeah, you know that phrase “I’ll be right out”? I used to hear this all the time when I was 
young. 
M: Really? How come? 
E: Well, I have two sisters and we were always fighting for the bathroom, so, someone was 
always saying “Just a minute! I’ll be right out!” 
M: Uh, yes, that’s common. I had that too when I was young. Okay, now our second phrase 
is it turns out that. 
E: It turns out that. 
M: It turns out that. 
E: It turns out that. This is a great phrase, you can use it in many different satiations. 
Marco, can you give us an example? 
M: Sure! For example, I can say “Frank didn’t come to work today and it turns out that he 
was sick”. 
E: Yep! Or I could say “Oh, I’ve been feeling really sick recently and it…”  
M: Why? 
E: “It turns out that I’m pregnant”. 
M: Oh, my God! Are you really pregnant? 
E: No, I’m not, Marco, I’m just kidding. 
M: Alright, because… Okay, so, it’s time for us to listen to our dialogue again, but this time 
it’ll be…  
E: A little bit slower. 
M: Alright. 
A: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again!
That’s the third time today! Hey Samuel, can
you come take a look at my PC? It’s acting up
again. It must have a virus or something.
B: Just give me a second; I’ll be right up.
B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns
out that you have a lot of infected files!
A: But I’m quite careful when I’m browsing the
internet, I have no idea how I could have picked
up a virus.
B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus
software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to
date, that’s probably what was causing your prob-
lems.
A: Ok. Anything else?
B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!
A: Um yeah… Sorry about that.
 
E: Okay, that was a lot more clear this time. 
M: Definitely, yeah, I understood a lot more. Okay, so, now it’s time to look at “fluency 
builder”. Erica, why don’t you explain what fluency builder is? 
E: In fluency builder we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas 
clearly. 
M: Okay, great, so, let’s look at fluency builder. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: Okay, so, in this dialogue we know his computer wasn’t working. 
M: Right, so, many students would probably say “His computer was acting strangely”. 
E: “His computer isn’t working properly”. 
M: Exactly, and that’s perfect and that’s fine. 
E: Yeah, but there’s a really great way to say it that we heard in the dialogue. 
Phrase 1: It’s acting up again. It’s acting up again. 
E: I love this phrase it’s acting up. Yeah… 
M: It just… 
E: It sounds really natural. 
M: It sounds really natural. Okay, we’re ready to listen to our dialogue a third time, but this 
time… 
E: It’ll be at the normal speed. Try and see if you can hear these keywords. 
A: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again!
That’s the third time today! Hey Samuel, can
you come take a look at my PC? It’s acting up
again. It must have a virus or something.
B: Just give me a second; I’ll be right up.
B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns
out that you have a lot of infected files!
A: But I’m quite careful when I’m browsing the
internet, I have no idea how I could have picked
up a virus.
B: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus
software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to
date, that’s probably what was causing your prob-
lems.
A: Ok. Anything else?
B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!
A: Um yeah… Sorry about that.
 
E: So, Marco, I really think that my computer actually has a virus now. 
M: Really? How come? 
E: Because I have been turning on my computer and then suddenly it turns off by itself. 
M: Uhu. 
E: It shuts down by itself. 
M: Yeah, that sounds like a virus. 
E: But I ran a virus scan and there was no problem. 
M: Hm, well, maybe your antivirus software isn’t up to date. 
E: Yeah, I guess I’d better call Samuel. 
M: Yeah! Yeah, you can call Samuel to fix it. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, folks, we’re out of time now, but be sure to go to our website at 
englishpod.com where you can leave all your questions and comments. 
E: So, stay tuned for our next great lesson and until next time… Good bye! 
M: Bye!
