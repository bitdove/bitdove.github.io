M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And we’re bringing you another great elementary lesson today. One that takes place at 
the office. 
E: Yes, today we’re gonna teach you some great phrases, so that you can ask people to 
help you. 
M: Right. And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, when you’re new, you always need to ask people for favors. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, we’re gonna be asking for a favor. 
E: So, Marco, what exactly is a favor? 
M: Something that a person does for you. 
E: Like a small helpful thing. 
M: Ah, Yeah, a small helpful thing, so… 
E: Uh. 
M: You know, like “can you pass me that pencil”. Maybe that’s even a favor. 
E: Yeah, or… 
M: Or… 
E: Maybe, uh, can you pick me up on your way to work. 
M: Yeah, that’s a favor. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Or even lending money… 
E: Yep. 
M: To your friend. 
E: Yeah. 
M: That’s a favor. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, that’s what we’re gonna be talking about – favors and how to ask for one. 
E: Cause you always have to do this at work. 
M: At work, with your friends. 
E: Uhu. 
M: With your family. So, let’s listen to the dialogue and then we’ll come back and explain all 
the vocabulary. 
A: Um, sorry to bother you, um... my name is
Rachel. I’m new here. Can I ask you a favor?
B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I’m afraid I can’t
help you right now. I’m getting ready for a very
important meeting.
A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?
C: You know what, I’d love to help you, but I’m about
to meet an important client. Do you wanna try
Sean instead? He sits right over there.
A: Sorry to interrupt you Sean, could you do me a
quick favor?
D: Actually, I’m working on a document that is due in
a couple minutes. I really can’t talk to you right
now. Sorry about that.
A: Geeze! I just want to know where the bathroom
is! What’s wrong with you people!
 
M: So, a pretty busy office. 
E: Pretty unhelpful colleagues.  
M: Hehe. I know everyone so busy… 
E: I know. 
M: They didn’t help this poor girl. 
E: Yeah, I hope she found the bathroom. 
M: Hehe. Now, let’s take a look at the language from the dialogue. So, let’s start with 
language takeaway. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: There’s some great language in this dialogue, wasn’t there? 
M: Yeah, a lot of, uh, interesting phrases and words. Um, the first one that… that I saw that 
was really interesting is on board. 
E: On board. 
M: Welcome on board. 
E: Well, we’ve got some examples of how this phrase is used. So, let’s listen to them to help 
us understand the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Welcome on board, Sarah; if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We need to get a new office assistant on board as soon as possible. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team. 
M: So, basically it means… 
E: Welcome to the company. 
M: Welcome to the company. 
E: Or. 
M: The team. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Welcome on board. 
E: So, “on board” is the same as “to the company”. 
M: I guess also when you get on a ship, they tell you “welcome on board”. 
E: Yes. That’s where it comes from. 
M: Or an airplane. 
E: Yeah-yeah, yeah. 
M: Welcome on board. Okay, let’s take a look at our next word – about to. 
E: About to. 
M: I’m about to. 
E: I’m about to. 
M: So, this a great phrase to explain that you’re about to do something. 
E: I’m going to do this thing really soon. 
M: Okay, so… so, for example, you can say “I’m about to go out for lunch”. 
E: Uhu. Or I could say “hey, Marco, let’s go record a show”. 
M: I’m about to going to a meeting. 
E: Uhu, exactly. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: About to. 
E: Going to do something really soon. 
M: Okay. The next word we have is instead. 
E: Instead. 
M: Instead. 
E: Instead. It means in the place of. 
M: In the place of. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, for example, if for a dinner I could say “I’ll have the chicken instead of the fish”.  
E: Uhu. 
M: Right? 
E: Or I can say “I wanted to buy a red sweater, but they didn’t have one, so I bought a blue 
one instead”. 
M: Instead. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay. So, in the place of. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And our last word for… language takeaway – interrupt. 
E: Interrupt. 
M: Interrupt. 
E: Interrupt. 
M: So, when somebody interrupts you, they’re coming and… 
E: The talk to you while you’re doing something or maybe while you’re speaking. 
M: Or maybe you’re busy… 
E: Aha. 
M: And people come and… and… 
E: Bother you. 
M: And bother you. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. 
E: So, interrupt. 
M: Interrupt. Okay, some great words here in our dialogue and now we can listen to it 
again. This time it’s gonna be a little bit slower… 
E: And you’ll be able to understand the language a little bit better. 
A: Um, sorry to bother you, um... my name is
Rachel. I’m new here. Can I ask you a favor?
B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I’m afraid I can’t
help you right now. I’m getting ready for a very
important meeting.
A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?
C: You know what, I’d love to help you, but I’m about
to meet an important client. Do you wanna try
Sean instead? He sits right over there.
A: Sorry to interrupt you Sean, could you do me a
quick favor?
D: Actually, I’m working on a document that is due in
a couple minutes. I really can’t talk to you right
now. Sorry about that.
A: Geeze! I just want to know where the bathroom
is! What’s wrong with you people!
 
M: Okay, so, there’re some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor, right? 
E: Yeah, we wanna show you some really useful phrases for asking for help. 
M: So, let’s start with “putting it together”. 
Voice: Putting it together. 
E: Let’s listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: May I get you to do me a favor? Can you carry this package and that suitcase for me?  
Voice: Example two. 
B: Can I ask you a favor? Can you just finish this report for me? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Could you do me a favor and pass me that file. 
M: Okay, so, those were great examples of asking for a favor. 
E: Yeah. 
M: In our dialogue we heard “Can I ask you a favor”. 
E: Uhu. But we could also say “Can I get you to do me a favor”. 
M: Right, can I get you to do me a favor. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Also I could say “Will you do me a favor”. 
E: Will you do me a favor. 
M: Right. So, those are different ways of asking for a favor. 
E: Let’s say you want to ask someone for a favor, right? 
M: Uhu. 
E: But they’re busy. 
M: Right. 
E: So, you’ll need some phrases to help you do this. 
M: Exactly, you need some phrases to interrupt somebody. 
E: Aha. 
M: Right? So, let’s listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to 
someone. 
E: Yeah, to interrupt them. 
M: Okay. 
Example 1: I hate to bother you, but… I hate to bother you, but… 
Example 2: I’m sorry to bother you, but… I’m sorry to bother you, but… 
Example 3: I don’t mean to bother you, but… I don’t mean to bother you, but… 
M: Okay, so, those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone. 
E: Exactly, they’re really useful at the office. 
M: So, maybe you wanna talk to your boss, you knock on his door, kind of open it a little bit 
and say “I’m sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you have time for meeting today”. 
E: Uhu. Or you could say “I hate to bother you, but do you have time for a meeting today”. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, those are great ways of starting up a conversation. 
E: Yep. 
M: And maybe setting it up to ask for a favor. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, we can combine them. I could say “I hate to bother you, but can you do me a favor”. 
E: Perfect. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah, really useful. 
M: So, then… then you can ask someone for a favor. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, great stuff. So, I guess we can listen to our dialogue again. 
E: Yeah, let’s listen to our dialogue for the third time and this time I’m sure you’ll 
understand it a lot better. 
A: Um, sorry to bother you, um... my name is
Rachel. I’m new here. Can I ask you a favor?
B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I’m afraid I can’t
help you right now. I’m getting ready for a very
important meeting.
A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?
C: You know what, I’d love to help you, but I’m about
to meet an important client. Do you wanna try
Sean instead? He sits right over there.
A: Sorry to interrupt you Sean, could you do me a
quick favor?
D: Actually, I’m working on a document that is due in
a couple minutes. I really can’t talk to you right
now. Sorry about that.
A: Geeze! I just want to know where the bathroom
is! What’s wrong with you people!
 
M: Alright, so, now you have all the vocabulary necessary the next time you need to ask 
someone for a favor.
