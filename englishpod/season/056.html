M: Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re gonna be bringing you a great lesson that’s talking about bank robbery. 
E: Yes, and this is an important, ah, lesson for all of our, um, you know, future bank 
robbers out there. 
M: Hehe. Yeah, we’re going to teach you some words that you would use for planning a, 
ah… a bank robbery, but you can apply them to other situations, hopefully not… yeah… 
E: I… Yeah, I hope you’ll apply them to other situations. 
M: Hopefully you won’t rob a bank, we don’t want to be responsible for any crimes… 
E: Yes. 
M: You would commit. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, so why don’t we start by looking for some of the vocabulary in “vocabulary 
preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have one word for you today that you’ll hear in the dialogue and it is filling in. 
M: Filling in. 
E: Filling in. 
M: So, to fill in for somebody, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: That means that you are replacing them. 
E: Yes, so if Marco can’t host the show today maybe Daini will fill in. 
M: Okay, so to take the place of someone. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Alright. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, so now let’s listen to our dialogue, let’s listen to this bank robbery and let’s see 
what happens. 
A: All right, so this is what we are going to do. I’ve
carefully mapped this out, so don’t screw it up.
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank
wearing these uniforms. We managed to get repli-
cas of the one the guards wear when they pick up
the money.
B: Got it.
C: No problem, boss.
A: When you get inside, tell them that you are filling
in for Carl and Tom, and say that they are on an-
other route today. Don’t lose your cool. Just act
natural.
B: What if they want to call and confirm?
A: You let him.
C: What!?
A: Don’t worry, we have the phones tapped, so the
call will be patched through to me, and I’ll pre-
tend to be the transport company.
B: Ha ha, you are so clever boss!
A: Okay, shut up. Only take as much money as you
can fit in these bags. Don’t get greedy! Are you
ready? Let’s go.
 
E: Well, it sounds like a pretty interesting plan. 
M: It does sound like a plan. Do you think it’ll work? 
E: Um, I don’t know, I guess we’ll have to maybe talk a little bit about that later. 
M: Okay. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Let’s take a look at the language that we saw in “language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Okay, we heard five really great words, ah, in this dialogue that I’d like to look at now in 
language takeaway. So let’s go to the first one, um, now we heard the boss say that they 
got replicas of the uniforms. 
M: Right, replicas. 
E: Replicas. 
M: Replicas. 
E: Replicas. 
M: So, it’s… this is really easy. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Something that’s a replica is a copy. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Right. So, for example, in Las Vegas there’s a replica of the Eifel Tower of Paris. 
E: Yes, actually I lived in a small city where there was also a replica of the Eifel Tower. 
M: Really? 
E: Yeah, in France, um, that… it’s kind of weird, you know. 
M: Hehe. Well, there’re a lot of replicas. Even now in the street maybe you can see replica 
watches… 
E: Aha. 
M: Right, that supposedly a Rolex… 
E: Yeah. 
M: But they’re not. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Ah, and many many other things, so copies. 
E: Yes, not the real thing. 
M: Not the real thing. Alright, so let’s take a look at our next word, tapped. 
E: We have the phones tapped. 
M: We have the phones tapped. 
E: Tapped. 
M: So, if you tapped someone’s phone… 
E: Uhu. 
M: You do something to the telephone line, so that you can hear their conversations, right? 
E: Right, and… and actually the police do this sometimes, right?  
M: Right. 
E: They… 
M: You see it in movies all the time. 
E: Yeah, yeah, you connect a wire to the phone, so you can listen to the conversation. 
M: Exactly, so you tap the telephone line. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, in our dialogue they tapped the bank’s phones, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: And then he said, if they make a call he will patch the call through… 
E: Yes. 
M: To him. 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: So, patch through. 
M: Patch through. 
E: Yeah, patch a call through. 
M: Patch through. Now, we still use this today… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Like if you call, ah… in office, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: And you say "Oh, can you patch me through to Carroll?" 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: So, can you connect me to another phone line. 
M: Connect me. 
E: Yep. 
M: Right. Alright, now let’s take a look at our next words, clever. 
E: Yes, the boss is very clever. 
M: The boss is very clever. 
E: Alright, so if you’re clever you’re… 
M: You’re smart. 
E: Yeah. 
M: You’re really smart. 
E: Yep. Right, simple, so the boss is quite clever and this is a clever plan. 
M: Clever plan, exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, let’s take a look at our last word, don’t be greedy. 
E: Greedy. 
M: Greedy. 
E: Greedy. 
M: To be greedy is a bad thing. 
E: Right, um, you want everything. 
M: You want everything for you. 
E: Yes. 
M: You don’t share. 
E: Yes, so like at lunch today when you had that cake. 
M: Hehe. And I didn’t share. 
E: Yeah. 
M: I was very greedy. 
E: Aha. 
M: Hehe. Yes, with food I’m greedy. 
E: Alright, so these are some great words and I think, um, you know, if we listen to the 
dialogue another time, um, a little bit more slowly, we’ll be able to hear them a little bit 
better. 
A: All right, so this is what we are going to do. I’ve
carefully mapped this out, so don’t screw it up.
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank
wearing these uniforms. We managed to get repli-
cas of the one the guards wear when they pick up
the money.
B: Got it.
C: No problem, boss.
A: When you get inside, tell them that you are filling
in for Carl and Tom, and say that they are on an-
other route today. Don’t lose your cool. Just act
natural.
B: What if they want to call and confirm?
A: You let him.
C: What!?
A: Don’t worry, we have the phones tapped, so the
call will be patched through to me, and I’ll pre-
tend to be the transport company.
B: Ha ha, you are so clever boss!
A: Okay, shut up. Only take as much money as you
can fit in these bags. Don’t get greedy! Are you
ready? Let’s go.
 
M: Okay, so now we understand these words that we talked about in language takeaway, 
so, now let’s take a look at some these great phrases in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: We’ve got three phrases for you here, um, and these are all phrases you might use when 
you’re planning something. 
M: Uhu. 
E: So, the first one, mapped out. 
M: I’ve carefully mapped this out. 
E: Mapped out. 
M: To map out. 
E: So when you map something out… what do you do? 
M: Well, you literally create a plan… 
E: Okay. 
M: You draw a map… 
E: Aha. 
M: Of what you’re going to do. 
E: So, here is the only for like travel or… 
M: No, no, no, it’s like, for example, if we’re starting a new project in the company… 
E: Uhu. 
M: You can map out the project. What you gonna do this month, next month. So, it’s a 
plan. 
E: So, you draw every step in the plan. 
M: Every step, right. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, you said, well, "I’ve mapped out this plan for a new project". 
E: Okay, interesting word, I think we should hear some examples of how it’s used. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: So, I have the future all mapped out. Well, you’ll get a job as a waiter, then we’ll get 
marred and two years latter we’ll start having kids. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We’re mapping out the marketing plan at the meeting today. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Okay, I’ve mapped out our trip and it should take about ten hours. 
M: Alright, so, mapped out, really really clear now. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Let’s take a look at our next word. 
E: Alright, so if you’ve mapped out the plan you don’t want to screw it up. 
M: Right, screw it up. 
E: Screw it up. 
M: Or screw up. 
E: Yep. 
M: So, to screw something up means that you made a mistake on something. 
E: Or you did something wrong. 
M: You did it wrong. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, so, for example, if I’m taking an exam and I make a mistake I screwed up on the 
exam. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Or, for example, here, when we’re recording Marco and I make mistakes a lot. 
M: Hehe. 
E: Maybe more me, than Marco. 
M: And we always screw up. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Hehe. Exactly, so, to make a mistake. It’s a really informal word, but very very common. 
E: Yeah, in… you know, it… it sounds really really natural when people use this.  
M: Alright, so, now let’s take a look at our last word, lose your cool. 
E: Lose your cool. 
M: Don’t lose your cool. 
E: So, what is this to lose you cool? So weird expression. 
M: It’s a weird expression. Why don’t we just give you an example of a person that loses his 
or her cool? 
Voice: What do you mean you’re not ready to go? It’s time to go! We have to go now…  
M: Okay, so basically you lose your temper, you become irritated. 
E: You lose control of your emotions. 
M: Right. 
E: So, Marco, when you lose your cool is it always that you get angry? 
M: You don’t always get angry, maybe get irritated or impatient. 
E: Or even nervous. 
M: Nervous. 
E: Yep. 
M: Right. So, basically you are not in control of your emotions. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, so we’ve looked at a lot of great phrases, a lot of great words. So we can listen to 
our dialogue now for the third time an then we’ll come back and talk about this bank 
robbery business. 
A: All right, so this is what we are going to do. I’ve
carefully mapped this out, so don’t screw it up.
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank
wearing these uniforms. We managed to get repli-
cas of the one the guards wear when they pick up
the money.
B: Got it.
C: No problem, boss.
A: When you get inside, tell them that you are filling
in for Carl and Tom, and say that they are on an-
other route today. Don’t lose your cool. Just act
natural.
B: What if they want to call and confirm?
A: You let him.
C: What!?
A: Don’t worry, we have the phones tapped, so the
call will be patched through to me, and I’ll pre-
tend to be the transport company.
B: Ha ha, you are so clever boss!
A: Okay, shut up. Only take as much money as you
can fit in these bags. Don’t get greedy! Are you
ready? Let’s go.
 
E: So there’s a lot of movies about bank robberies, but obviously they happen in real life, so 
this dialogue is actually based on real events, right? 
M: Yeah, this actually happened in real life and, so, it’s actually a very creative and non-
violent way of, ah, robbing a bank. 
E: Okay, so what happened? 
M: Basically, this guy went to a bank dressed up as one of the security guards that 
transport the money from the bank to an… another save place. 
E: Uhu. 
M: He had fake credentials of replica credentials and replica… 
E: So, fake ID. 
M: Yeah, he had replica of the uniform… 
E: Wow. 
M: And he walked in, he took all these bags with… him and his partner, they took them to 
the truck and drove off and the bank didn’t realize that they had been robbed, they thought 
it was a routine thing. Three or four hours later the… the real security guard shows up. They 
were long gone and they still can’t find them. 
E: Really? 
M: Yeah. 
E: So, a very clever plan. 
M: Very clever and very effective, I think they stole over half a million dollars. 
E: Okay, well, guys don’t try this at home. 
M: Hehe. Don’t’ try this at home, but… real life, real English, right? 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay, so… ah, come to our website, leave you questions and comments, tell us what you 
think will happen with these guys. Do you think they’ll be successful? Do you think they’ll 
get caught? 
E: Yeah, they might end up in jail, who knows. 
M: Maybe somebody will lose their cool… 
E: Yep. 
M: And get caught, right? 
E: Well, thanks for listening, guys, and until next time… good bye! 
M: Bye!
