M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re going back to the movies. 
E: That’s right, we’ve got a great lesson today and I’m really excited about this dialogue. I 
think it’s fantastic. 
M: Hehe. We have an original EnglishPod production of a movie trailer. 
E: So, what is a movie trailer? 
M: Well, whenever you go to the cinema… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Um, before the movie starts you have previews of upcoming movies. 
E: So, like almost an advertisement for a future movie. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, that’s a movie trailer and that’s what we’re bringing you today. 
E: A lot of great language you’ll commonly hear in action movies. 
M: Right, so, let’s start with “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have one word today – possess. 
M: Possess. 
E: Possess. 
M: Possess. 
E: So, when you possess something, you… 
M: Have it. 
E: Aha. 
M: It’s in your possession. You… 
E: Simple. 
M: You have it, right? 
E: Yep. 
M: So, in this dialogue our actors possess something very important. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time and it’s going to be a little bit fast and a 
little bit difficult to understand. 
E: But don’t worry, we’ll come back and explain all of the key language later. 
A: In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for
survival. Two people, possess a secret so valu-
able, so powerful, they have to defend it at all
costs.
B: I don’t care where they are, I don’t care what it
takes... you find them and bring them to me!
A: They only had one chance! And their chance was
to fight back!
D: You wanna play rough? Okay, say hello to my little
friend!
A: With a little help from a Governor...
C: Listen to me! We have to get them outta there!
No matter what!
A: Nothing will prevent them from doing their job!
Double the action.
D: Get down!
A: Triple the excitement.
D: Get down again!
A: This summer... nothing will stand in their way.
B: I’m going to make him an offer he can’t refuse.
A: Two hosts, one podcast, coming to a theater near
you.
 
M: Wow, so, it sounds like a really good movie. 
E: I know. When is it coming out? 
M: Uh, I think in two thousand fifteen (2015). 
E: Okay, I’ll put that in my calendar. 
M: Hehe. Okay, let’s take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this dialogue in language 
takeaway. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: In language takeaway today we have three words. What’s our first one? 
E: Survival. 
M: Survival. 
E: Survival. 
M: Survival. 
E: Well, survival is continuing to live even in really hard times. 
M: It comes from the verb to survive. 
E: Aha. 
M: Right? So, survival is the noun form. 
E: Right, so… so maybe you are lost in… in… 
M: The jungle. 
E: The jungle and you have to fight for survival. 
M: Right, you have to try to survive. 
E: Aha. 
M: Okay, our next word – defend. 
E: Defend. 
M: Defend. 
E: Defend. 
M: So, let’s listen to some examples of defend, so you can understand the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: We have to defend the castle. The army is trying to kill the king! 
Voice: Example two. 
B: The soldiers defended the base in the difficult battle. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: These new machine guns will defend us. 
M: So, basically, it’s to protect, right? 
E: Right, to protect from something that is really harmful. 
M: Okay, so, you would defend your children. 
E: Aha. 
M: You would defend your… 
E: Your house. 
M: Your house. 
E: Or your castle. 
M: Your dog, your cat. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. And our last word on language takeaway – rough. 
E: Rough. 
M: Rough. 
E: R-O-U-G-H. Rough. 
M: Right, it’s got that “ugh”… 
E: Yep. 
M: Sound. 
E: Aha. 
M: So, it basically means… so when something is rough, it’s a little bit violent… 
E: And hard… 
M: Hard. 
E: Yeah. 
M: For example, boxing is a rough sport. 
E: Or hockey is also a rough sport. 
M: Exactly, so, you have rough sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough. 
E: Yes. Or that person can play rough. 
M: Play rough, exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, rough. Okay, so, we’re ready to listen to our dialogue again. 
E: And this time it’ll be a little bit slower, so, you can understand the language a little bit 
more clearly. 
A: In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for
survival. Two people, possess a secret so valu-
able, so powerful, they have to defend it at all
costs.
B: I don’t care where they are, I don’t care what it
takes... you find them and bring them to me!
A: They only had one chance! And their chance was
to fight back!
D: You wanna play rough? Okay, say hello to my little
friend!
A: With a little help from a Governor...
C: Listen to me! We have to get them outta there!
No matter what!
A: Nothing will prevent them from doing their job!
Double the action.
D: Get down!
A: Triple the excitement.
D: Get down again!
A: This summer... nothing will stand in their way.
B: I’m going to make him an offer he can’t refuse.
A: Two hosts, one podcast, coming to a theater near
you.
 
M: So, we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue. Let’s take a look at them in 
“fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: The first phrase that we saw – at all costs. 
E: At all costs. 
M: At all costs. 
E: At all costs. 
M: So, let’s listen to some examples before we explain “at all costs”. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I’ll protect my kids at all costs. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We have to get this project done at all costs. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: You find those criminals at all costs. 
E: Well, if you’re going to protect your kids at all costs, you’re going to protect them even if 
it’s a really hard. 
M: Right, it doesn’t matter how hard it is or what you have to do. 
E: Exactly. 
M: You’ll do it. 
E: Uhu. 
M: At all costs. Now we have, um… now let’s take a look at our second phrase for fluency 
builder and it’s very similar to at all costs. 
E: Yeah, really similar. 
M: No matter what. 
E: No matter what. 
M: No matter what. 
E: No matter what. 
M: For example, I’m going to go on vacation no matter what my boss says. 
E: Nothing’s gonna stop you. 
M: Right, if he says no, I’m still going on my vacation. 
E: And I’m gonna protect my kids no matter what. 
M: Exactly, no matter what. 
E: I don’t have kids, though. 
M: Hehe. But you will protect them no matter what. 
E: If I had them. 
M: Hehe. Okay. Uh, and our last phrase – stand in their way. 
E: Stand in their way. 
M: Stand in their way. 
E: Stand in their way. 
M: So, let’s listen to some examples of “stand in someone’s way”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And then we’ll come back and explain it. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Don’t let anything stand in the way of your goals. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’m going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I don’t care what happens. I’m gonna get that money and you’d better not stand in my 
way. 
M: So, when something stands in your way, it’s… 
E: It’s preventing you from reaching your goal. 
M: From reaching your goal, right? Or we can also have somebody standing in your way 
physically. 
E: Like really you’re standing close to me and I can’t pass through the door. 
M: Right, right. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, maybe that person is at the door and… is standing in my way. I can’t go in. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. 
E: But here we’re not really talking about a real thing, right? That you can touch. 
M: Right, it’s more of some obstacle that’s preventing you from reaching you goals or from 
doing what you want to do. 
E: Yep. 
M: So, now we can listen to our dialogue again and now you can understand these words 
that we’ve just talked about. 
A: In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for
survival. Two people, possess a secret so valu-
able, so powerful, they have to defend it at all
costs.
B: I don’t care where they are, I don’t care what it
takes... you find them and bring them to me!
A: They only had one chance! And their chance was
to fight back!
D: You wanna play rough? Okay, say hello to my little
friend!
A: With a little help from a Governor...
C: Listen to me! We have to get them outta there!
No matter what!
A: Nothing will prevent them from doing their job!
Double the action.
D: Get down!
A: Triple the excitement.
D: Get down again!
A: This summer... nothing will stand in their way.
B: I’m going to make him an offer he can’t refuse.
A: Two hosts, one podcast, coming to a theater near
you.
 
E: I know that you’re a big movie fan, right? 
M: Yeah, I’m a big movie fan I usually watch maybe three or five movies a week. 
E: Really? 
M: Yeah-yeah. 
E: Wow! Many students of English like to watch movies as a way to improve their English. 
M: That’s one of the best ways to learn English… 
E: Uhu. 
M: As through songs and movies. 
E: What do you think of some useful movies that people can watch to practice English? 
M: Well, I would recommend children’s movies. 
E: Really? 
M: Yeah, they have simple vocabulary, but they have very common language. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And also what’s happening in the movie is very easy to understand and to follow. 
E: So. You can see the action and then hear the word. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, if you like to watch movies, rent a DVD or go buy a DVD, watch it in the original 
language… 
E: Yeah. 
M: With English subtitles. 
E: So, you should watch it in English. 
M: With English subtitles. 
E: Yeah, and what is subtitles? 
M: Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate… 
E: Okay. 
M: What the people are saying. 
E: Okay. 
M: Yeah, that’s the best thing to do. Try that exercise. If you have a pen and paper with 
you, it’s much better. You can pause the movie, write down the word you don’t understand 
and then maybe review it later. 
E: That’s a really good tip. I always tell my students that they should watch movies, listen 
to music, read the newspaper and write down at least five new words or phrases a week. 
M: Yeah, yeah. 
E: Yeah. 
M: It’s a really good exercising, you’ll improve a lot. 
E: Yes. So, everyone, we want you to go and watch a movie in English. Turn on the 
subtitles and write down some new vocabulary. 
M: Exactly. And if you have any comments or questions or maybe even suggestions, you 
can come to our website at englishpod.com and leave them in our community page. 
E: Yeah, Marco and I are always around to help you and we love to hear about what you’re 
learning and what movies you’re watching. 
M: Exactly. So, we’re out of time today. We’ll see you guys next time. Until then it’s… 
E: Good bye. 
M: Bye.
