M: Hello English learners! And welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod! My 
name is Marco. 
E: And I'm Erica. 
M: And today we have another really great lesson for you – elementary lesson. 
E: That's right and that's another lesson about money. 
M: We have no money here at EnglishPod, we are in debt here. 
E: In debt! 
M: Yes. 
E: Okay. 
M: In dept. 
E: In debt. 
M: So, what does that mean? Why don't you tell us? 
E: If I owe you money, I'm in debt. 
M: In debt, yes. 
E: In fact, I think I am in debt to you. 
M: Hehe. You owe me two fifty (2,50) for a coke zero today. 
E: That's true. 
M: Hehe. Alright. Okay, so, let's get started; let's take a look at our “vocabulary preview”.  
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have two words today in our vocabulary preview and the first one is recession. 
M: Recession. 
E: Recession. 
M: Recession. 
E: So, recession. Everyone's talking about it right now and what does it mean? 
M: I don't know. 
E: Hehe. 
M: Hehe. That's your topic. I don't know. I really don't know, why don't you tell me, Erica, 
cause this isn't my topic for today? 
E: Okay. 
M: Hehe. 
E: Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly. 
M: In a recession the country is making less money. 
E: That's true, so, maybe we can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession 
to show the meaning of this a little bit better. 
M: Right, so, for example, in a recession many people lose their jobs. 
E: Because, uh, companies might close or go bankrupt. 
M: Exactly, and also people start spending less money. 
E: That's true, and the stock prices of companies, um, fall pretty dra… 
M: ??? fall. 
E: Yeah, they… they fall a lot, hey? 
M: Yeah, yeah, and that's what's going on now in the United States. 
E: Very true. 
M: Okay, so, let's take a look at our second word and it has to do with recession, it's broke. 
E: Broke. 
M: Broke. 
E: I'm broke. 
M: Broke, it means that you have no money, you're broke. 
E: I'm broke. 
M: Right, so, these are our two words for vocabulary preview today and you're going to 
hear them in the dialogue. 
E: This dialogue is about a man who is in debt, he's broke. Let's find out what happens. 
A: Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Corleone.
B: Right this way, sir.
C: Charlie! What can I do for you?
B: Mr. Corlone, I’m really sorry to trouble you, but I
need your help.
C: Anything for you, Charlie! Your father was like a
brother to me.
B: Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty
hard; I lost my job and I’m in a lot of debt.
C: I see. . . . . .
B: Yeah, you know, I’ve got credit card bills, car pay-
ments, I’ve got to pay my mortgage; and on top of
all that, I have to pay my son’s college tuition.
C: So you’re asking for a loan.
B: Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.
C: What? At a time like this? I’m broke too, you
know! You’re not the only one who has been hit
by the recession! I lost half my money in the stock
market crash! Go on! Get outa here!
 
M: Okay, so, that was a bit unexpected. 
E: Yeah, that was certainly strange. He didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he? 
M: No, he went to the mob. 
E: O… 
M: And the mob is broke 
E: Oh, no! You know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money.  
M: Hehe. Alright, so, why don't we start by looking at our “language takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Alright, so, for today's language takeaway we have four words from the dialogue, which 
we think are really important. 
M: Yes, so, why don't we start with the first one? Loan. 
E: Loan. 
M: Loan. 
E: Loan. 
M: So, Erica, tell us about a loan? What is a loan? 
E: Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan. 
M: A loan, yes. Not to be confused with alone, like by myself. Hehe. 
E: No, so, this is L-O-A-N. 
M: Loan. 
E: Right. 
M: Okay, great. Let's take a look at our second word – mortgage. 
E: Mortgage. 
M: Mortgage. 
E: Mortgage. 
M: Now, this is very common. I'm sure many of you have mortgages. What is a mortgage? 
E: A mortgage is a type of a loan. Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house. 
M: A house or property. 
E: Yeah, so, this is a funny word. I mean there's the strange mortgage with a T. 
M: Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it, you say mor[t]gage, mor[t]gage. 
E: So, not mort… morTgage. 
M: Not, morTgage. 
E: Mor[t]gage. 
M: Mor[t]gage, yeah. I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so, I learned it well 
now. 
E: Okay. Let's move to our third word today. 
M: Hit me pretty hard. 
E: Hit me pretty hard. 
M: Hit me pretty hard. 
E: Hit me pretty hard. I think we have some examples that will help us understand this 
phrase. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: My divorce hit me pretty hard. I’m so depressed. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: This cold has hit me pretty hard. I’ve been in bed for a week. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The news of Fluffy’s death hit me pretty hard. I’ve been crying for days. 
M: Okay, so, that's a lot clear. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Great. Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway? 
E: Tuition. 
M: Tuition. 
E: Tuition. 
M: Tuition. 
E: So, this is the money you have to pay to your school, so, that you can study there. 
M: Right, um, usually it's in college, right, or university? 
E: Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school. 
M: Okay, great, so, it's time to listen to our dialogue again and it's gonna be slower, so we 
can listen to all the words that we just talked about. 
A: Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Corleone.
B: Right this way, sir.
C: Charlie! What can I do for you?
B: Mr. Corlone, I’m really sorry to trouble you, but I
need your help.
C: Anything for you, Charlie! Your father was like a
brother to me.
B: Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty
hard; I lost my job and I’m in a lot of debt.
C: I see. . . . . .
B: Yeah, you know, I’ve got credit card bills, car pay-
ments, I’ve got to pay my mortgage; and on top of
all that, I have to pay my son’s college tuition.
C: So you’re asking for a loan.
B: Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.
C: What? At a time like this? I’m broke too, you
know! You’re not the only one who has been hit
by the recession! I lost half my money in the stock
market crash! Go on! Get outa here!
 
E: Okay, so, I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now, 
but you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue. 
M: Yes, I did too, so, let's start with “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: 'Fluency builder' is a tool that we use to help you sound more native. 
M: Right, so, you can sound more natural when you're speaking. 
E: So, we take a really common phrase and we show you some great natural ways of 
expressing that same idea. 
M: Exactly, and today we have three of these examples. Let's start with the first one. 
E: So, this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody “Can I help you?” 
Phrase 1: What can I do for you? What can I do for you? 
E: Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural. 
M: Right, so, instead of saying “Can I help you” or… I don't know, “What do you need”, we 
can just say what can I do for you. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Great. 
E: So, let's move to our second phrase. This phrase we use when we need something, when 
we wanna say “I'm sorry to bother you”. 
M: Or “I'm sorry to interrupt”. 
E: Okay, let's listen. 
Phrase 2: I’m really sorry to trouble you. I’m really sorry to trouble you. 
E: I’m sorry to trouble you. This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand 
how it's used, um, but we've got some examples. 
M: Yes, so, let's listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Can I trouble you for a moment? I just need you to sign this form for me. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’m sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Can I trouble you for a pen? Mine is not working anymore. 
M: Okay, so, now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder – on top of all 
that. 
E: On top of all that. 
M: On top of all that. 
E: This is a really useful phrase. Marco, how would you use it? 
M: Well, for example, today I lost my job… 
E: Oh, no. 
M: My car got stolen. 
E: Oh, my God. 
M: And on top of all that my girlfriend broke up with me. 
E: That was a terrible day. 
M: It was, but don't worry, you can use this phrase also in a positive way. 
E: That's true, you could say “So, today was a really great day! It was my birthday and all 
my friends came to visit me and on top of all that I got a million presents”. 
M: Hehe. That is a great day, so, you can use on top of all that in this way. 
E: It's like “and also”. 
M: And also, yeah. 
E: Yeah, so, on top of all that. 
M: So, we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time. We can hear all the words that we 
just talked about and all the phrases and you'll definitely be able to understand a lot better 
now. 
A: Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Corleone.
B: Right this way, sir.
C: Charlie! What can I do for you?
B: Mr. Corlone, I’m really sorry to trouble you, but I
need your help.
C: Anything for you, Charlie! Your father was like a
brother to me.
B: Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty
hard; I lost my job and I’m in a lot of debt.
C: I see. . . . . .
B: Yeah, you know, I’ve got credit card bills, car pay-
ments, I’ve got to pay my mortgage; and on top of
all that, I have to pay my son’s college tuition.
C: So you’re asking for a loan.
B: Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.
C: What? At a time like this? I’m broke too, you
know! You’re not the only one who has been hit
by the recession! I lost half my money in the stock
market crash! Go on! Get outa here!
 
E: Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right? 
M: Yes. 
E: And… and different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in 
debt. 
M: Yes, that's true, for example, in North America and in Canada it's a really common thing. 
E: Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt. 
M: It's more than good, it's necessary to be in debt. 
E: That's right, unless you have… a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your 
debts, you can't actually borrow money, you can't get a mortgage, you can't get a… a car 
loan, so you can buy a new car. 
M: Right, that's called a credit history, so, you must have a good credit history in order 
to be able to, like you say, buy a car or buy a house. 
E: Yeah, and you know the funny thing is, um, when I was in university, maybe I was 
eighteen years old, the first thing that happened at university was, you know, banks came 
to our university and started offering you credit cards, so, you can get a credit card when 
you're eighteen no problem. 
M: And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you like free gifts if you sign up 
for a credit card. 
E: I know they really want you to have a credit card. 
M: Of course they want you to spend more money, that’s the trick. 
E: Yeah, but you know what, it's totally different in Europe, for example, I used to live in 
Switzerland and there they're really careful with debts like it's a bad thing to be in debt.  
M: Oh, yeah, I mean it's bad to be in debt, definitely. 
E: For example, if I wanna have a credit card in Switzerland and let’s say I want to have a 
limit of, um, five hundred (500) francs that I can spend every month, I need to put in my 
bank account seven hundred (700) francs before I can even spend that credit card money, 
so, it's totally opposite from North America. 
M: Hehe. Well, yeah, I mean in North America it's crazy the way that people are in debt and 
it's showing now with the recession, right? 
E: Yeah, that's true. 
M: So, everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully, don't be in debt unless you 
really, really have to. 
E: Good financial advice from EnglishPod.
